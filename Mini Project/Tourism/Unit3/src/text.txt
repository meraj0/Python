Travelling Tips to Kurukshetra



Post by Neeraj | Gwalior | Jan 11, 2013
You can pick a Volvo from ISBT delhi and it takes 3.5 hrs to reach on a very nice road. You can take trains like shane - punjab etc to reach there.
This place is good for blankets so you can buy nice quality blanket in very low cost.

Travelling Tips to Chail



An escape to nature
Post by Kunal | Chandigarh | Apr 5, 2011
Bus from Shimla, Chandigarh, Solan... but i would sugget train from Kalka to Shimla then taxi upto Chail... from Chandigarh, adventure lovers can go bike too!
Read full review 





GODS OWN PLACE
Post by Niraj | Taliwang | Dec 11, 2012
A good single road to Chail..Its a steep climb and the vehicle need to have good clutch plates otherwise a wonderful drive. Road is bit narrow so no high speeding required and when you occassionaly see a vehicle coming from the opposite direction its better for either of the vehicle to stop and let the other pass by. When raining its better to look for some small villages on the way to stop and wait for the rain to stop as the road becomes bit slippery and no need to take chance.

Travelling Tips to Dalhousie



Perfect Summer Break
Post by Sandeep | Gurgaon | Jun 26, 2012
Love driving and stay in and around Delhi , drive your own car
Reach by rail to chakki bank and then hire a taxi to dalhousie in 1500 rs.and vice versa.
If want to travel by bus, reach Pathankot and hire a Volvo or taxi (advance booking on male trip or redbuds.in)

Magical Place
Post by Poonam | Mumbai | Jun 19, 2012
One can reach Dalhousie via Pathankot, Amritsar or Dharamshala via tourist vehicle. Do not travel during month of feb - march. Due to heavy snow fall one may stuck downway to Dalhousie i.e. near bus stop,

A tranquil getaway
Post by SML | Bangalore | Apr 27, 2010
The best (and only) way to reach Dalhousie is by road. We took a cab from Pathankot ( after an overnight 10-hr journey by train from Delhi). Took us about 2.5 hrs to reach D'housie through the twists and turns. It would be a good idea to contact your hotel and see if they could arrange for a cab (just to ensure reliability of the driver).
One caution: Get some motion-sickness medicines from your doc before this trip since the slopes and bends are sure to make you throw up more than once.

Dalhousie - A serene break from daily chaos
Post by hym | Delhi | Apr 27, 2010
Train:
You can reach Dalhousie via Pathankot. If you are going from Delhi, there are two trains for Pathankot: Jammu Mail (daily, but hard to find a reservation) and Dhauladhar Exp (alternate days, I got a confirmed reservation when Jammu mail had 35+ waiting). They both drop you at Pathankot in the morning.
Form Pathankot, you can take a bus or a taxi. Taxi usually charges Rs 1500.
Tip: If you have motion sickness, do not eat anything in 3-4 hrs before you leave.
Again, if you are from Delhi, contact Imazine Holidays (www.imazineholidays.co.in) at Dwarka, sec 10. They gave a me a very nice package which included sightseeing, hotel accommodation, and pick/up drop, much less than the other tour operators.

Dalhousie Travelogue
Post by Hesitant Traveller | Delhi | Sep 30, 2009
Reaching there: Reach Pathankot and hire a taxi (Rs. 1300) as the buses are shabby and their journey tiresome.
Book a hotel on either end of the Mall road.
Ba ready to shell out money on taxi (inside and outside Dalhousie).

The Foodies' paradise in the hills !
Post by Vikas | Delhi | Jul 4, 2006
A few steps further is the German restaurant: sounds like fancy place but has palm leaf (dried) roof with pebble stones as floor: enjoy the Pizza, Pasta and the Salads. Folks seem to be enjoying the Indian food here too !
Finally dinner at Pema Thang brought us close to authentic Tibetian food. Also some of the novel Pizzas (pineapple included) !
Foodies enjoy..the fun of discovering these new places !

A unique place to view sun-set (naddi)
Post by Ashok | Delhi | May 3, 2012
Reach m'clodganj via dharamshala. naddi is around 6 kms away from m'clodganj. you can reach by your own conveyance or taxi or local buses also.
to get a good place to stay at reasonable rates try to reach before 3 p.m. after which time customer's bargaining power reduces to half reason being, availability of vacant rooms reduces resulting into higher room charges. himgiri resorts is one of the best places to stay there.

Avoid traveling in monsoon as it is pouring and all sights are invisible. In other seasons you can take the flight from Delhi if you want to cut down travel time. In case you are flying into Delhi, please take a connecting flight of Kingfisher ONLY as they will adjust you in case of delays/cancellations.
By road it is accessible from Most of Northern Punjab, like Pathankot. A direct cab from Delhi will take around 7 hours in good conditions and about 12 hours by bus.

Kasauli -a relaxing getaway
Post by Vishal | Mumbai | Jun 15, 2006
It is 55 kms from Chandigarh and can be reached by bus/ car. Kasauli has a small market catering to items of daily needs, other than that there is nothing to write home about. There is only one chemist shop so if you are on any special medication be sure to carry it along as you may not get it in kasauli.

Kasauli - The sleepy Hill Station
Post by HimanshuG | Delhi | Jun 1, 2006
Just off the Kalka-Shimla highway, Kasauli is connected to Shimla, chandigarh and Kalka by regular, local buses. Travelling by rail between Shimla and Kalka, get off at Dharampuri and then take a 12km. bus ride.
Good food can be had at Giani's dhaba at dharampuri. Weather is pleasant throughout year and winters are deceptively cold.

Himachal Paradise
Post by Preeti  | Mumbai | Feb 23, 2012
We took the Kalka Mail express train from Delhi to Kalka station. The station is approx 40 km from the hill station so prepared to have a private car pickup. Kalka is a bustling town in itself but the climb is steep and getting around to a bus stand or a taxi would seem a tedious task. The closest airport is Chandigarh which is approx 60 Km from Kasauli.

kasauli tourism
Post by Denis | Chandigarh | Nov 2, 2010
By Air : Nearest airport is at Chandigarh (65 km) and Shimla (73 km) from Kasauli. Major domestic airlines fly between Delhi and Chandigarh. Tourist can take taxi or bus to reach Kasauli.
By Rail : Prain route is the best way to reach Kasauli as it passes through lush green forests and mountain ranges. The nearest railhead is at Kalka, 37 km away, from where one can take taxi, which takes an hour to reach Kasauli.
By Road : Kasauli is 315 Kms away from Delhi and tourist can cover this distance with the help of state transport buses or private taxis. These transports are easily available for Kasauli from Delhi, Chandigarh, Kalka and Shimla.
By Internal Transport : Travelling inside the city is convenient and comfortable. There are taxis, autos and buses, which are readily available from all the major intersections of the city.

Travelling Tips to Kufri



Kufri
Post by Jitin | Faridabad | Dec 17, 2012

A nice place with cheats around
Post by Rahul | Gurgaon | Aug 31, 2010
While going from Shimla you will find several youths who will represent themselves as local guide. Don't believe them as they are the agents of the donkeywalas at Kufri and will accompny only till base point. They will introduce you to any donkeywalas and take commission from them. Don't hire any donkey. They are just waste of money. Donkeywalas are cheat and sometimes they are even dangerous (I had to cal local police when I visited Kufri last time. Local police is quite helpful). Just walk up the hill, its more entertaining than riding dolkey.

Calm and silent place
Post by Don
Please be careful while driving. some streches are steap. the drive to hatu peak is highky dangerous and adventurous. Also there are snowy seasons when it becomes difficult to drive. During 1st week of august you can enjoy apples which would be ripe by then

Hotel at Kufri; what to take care of:
Post by Amit | Delhi | Oct 30, 2012
If you want to go at minimum cost:
1. From Kalka take Toy Train if you have the time otherwise catch a state bus for shimla and reach shimla within 3 hours.
2. Then take a hotel at shimla or reach kufri via Bus or Car and book the hotel holiday inn.
3. After reaching hotel, fresh yourself and enjoy Kufri environment through Horse riding, trekking, etc.
4. AT returning book a car and visit mall road, Jakku Mandir, etc.
5. Plan for at least 2 nights and 2 days to enjoy.

Travelling Tips to Lahaul and Spiti





Keylong in November
Post by Madhuri | Mumbai | May 24, 2008
One of the best ways is to take a taxi from Manali, as it allows you the flexibility of stopping wherever you want to. One can also get buses which ply from Manali. Manali itself can be reached by air from Delhi, or by Volvo buses from Delhi and Chandigarh. One should avoid the region between November to May, because everything is closed down at the time, and you might find yourself unable to get out of Spiti until Rohtang opens up again.

A world out of this World
Post by Dr.shekhar | Jaipur | Apr 28, 2006
To visit lahaul and spiti it is best to approach it from manali via rohtang pass. There are taxi services available from manali. On your own, one must go in a qualis or sumo or any four by four vehicle as the terrain is very tough. A driver experienced in such terrain is a must. Carry enough warm clothing, sleeping bags and dry rations so that in emergency survival is easier. Accomodations are very limited at Losar, Kaza and Tabo. As the trip involves altitude in excess of 14000 ft precautions about low oxygen and dizzyness should be taken. In general it is a rough trip so be warned.

Keylong - An ideal destination for nature lovers
Post by Coolman | Delhi | Oct 6, 2008
1. you can reach upto Kullu by air and then by pvt taxi or bus.
2. direct bus from delhi, volvo or any other deluxe bus. these buses normally takes 12-13 hrs to reach manali and from there Taxi or another bus although their is direct bus for Keylong also which takes around 24 hrs (avoid such a long journey and halt at either kullu or manali).
3.	By own vehicle. Total journey is around 1400 kms (to and fro) and one can take halt at kullu or manali. Get your vehicle serviced b4 departure. Prefer 4X4 vehicle although we went in Alto

Walk on the Wild Side
Post by Anshuman
How to reach ?
The nearest international airport is at Delhi. From here one can either, catch a flight (once a day) to Bhuntar (Manali) airport, in Himachal Pradesh and take a taxi to Manali or take an over night bus from Delhi to Manali (12 hrs). With a days stop at Manali, one can start for Kaza the next day morning either by the bus that leaves at 5:30 am (12 hrs) or take a taxi which comes at a price of Rs. 3000-4000. Once you are in Kaza; Kibber, Ki Gompa, Tabo and Dhankar Gompa can be reached by using the local buses and taxis. Foreigners require Inner Line Permits which are easily available at the magistrates office in Kaza.
Regional Weather and Best Time to Visit
Spiti is cut off from the main State for almost up to eight months of the year due to heavy snow. However the best time to visit is between June and mid October. During the rest of the year, frequent landslides and flooding, block the route giving travelers a chance to hike some of the way. The climate is typically that of a desert, hot in the day with very bright sun and cold in the nights with chilly winds.
Places to stay in Kaza
Hill View Guest House is highly recommended.
HPTDC Tourist Lodge is a high end choice (tel +91-1906-222566)
Snow Line Hotel and Little Italy Restaurant (tel +91-1906-222257)
Places to stay in Kibber
Norling Guest house is highly recommended for its good rooms and clean western toilets. The owner is a Buddhist monk (Tseten Lama) and loves trekking. He is familiar with the whole region like the back of his hand. He also works as a guide, for treks or visits to nearby gompas and can arrange for tents, rations, stove, etc if pre informed (tel +91-1906-226242)

Spiti - The Silver River
Post by Tom
Reaching spiti is as much of a journey as your journey in Spiti and involves overnight buses from Delhi - Shimla / Manali and then a further 16hrs by taxi to Kaza the capital.
I opted to have Lara pick me up in Manali so we began the trip as soon as we cross the Kunzum la pass, stopping at Chandertal Lake *full Moon lake* and some of the cute villages immediately.

Travelling Tips to Manali





It Is Enchanting As Ever Before
Post by Kulwant | Noida | Jun 10, 2011
I travelled from Delhi - Chandigarh by morning Shatabadi Train separture at 7.40. Reached Chandigarh at 11.15 in the morning & started our onward journey to Manali in Pre- booked Cab. It Is 10 hours long journey covering distance of 310 km. in between 2-3 stoppages for lunch , tea, refreshments etc... Reached Manali hotel at 9.30 in night & transferred to our rooms within 10 minutes of our arrival. The manager himself was waiting on the reception for our arrival , he often queried about our arrival time while we were on our way to Manali.After refreshing ourselves ,had light dinner in hotel restaurant & straight away hit the bed as it was 10.30 already & we had to get up at 3'o clock early morning to go to Rohtang Pass. The precautions one should take while travelling to & in Manali is , first travel light stomach , dont gulp heavy fried dishes before & during the journey. good for you health & others too.Or you may while sick .Carry light woolens while travelling, Beacuse weather in & around Manali can change in no time.It is my personal advise to all the tourists that they should visit this place only if you are physically fit enough to face the rough road & weather conditions.Best time to visit this place is between May - June & if you love to enjoy only snow than October - December. Well that's all for now . Have a happy & safe journey to Manali. It is definitely worth visiting this place at least once in your life time

SWITZERLAND OF INDIA - MANALI !!!
Post by Kulwant | Noida | Jun 5, 2007
It was not easy decision to make of how to travel from Delhi  Manali & visiting sightseeings. Well as I mentioned that I have to keep my budget in control. So after a brief research I decided to break my journey in to 2 parts .Initially I was left with 3 options to choose from. First option was to take a direct deluxe bus from Delhi  Manali , travellling 16 hours by bus & that too most of the night journey & about 100 kms. Of mountain road & same journey schedule for coming back gave me creeps. The other point which I would like to make is that suppose if this journey is to be made by my friends who dont belong to delhi but are coming from Kolkata, Chennai , Hyderabd , Bangalore etc.. Already travelled a long distance to reach Delhi & from their onwards this journey by bus could be a real tiring & there are chances that you may get sick. So, this option was dropped instantly. The second option was to travel by train from delhi  chandigarh & then by car from Chandigarh  manali .But again this option was dropped when gathered information that the train timings & then travel by car to manali doesnt click together & doesnt suit us , again the night journey by road was involved, you guys must be thinking why I am not in favor of night journey , the reason is simple guys if you travel at night by road you are going to miss the most beautiful sightseeings on the way to Manali, so travel in day time & reach manali by evening admiring the natures beauty all the way . So the 3rd & the only best option left was to travel by train from Delhi  Pathankot & then by car from Pathankot  Manali. This turned out be a perfect travelling plan for us & I am thankful to god for making it such a pleasant trip.The route which we shall follow to manali was Pathankot  Palampur  Jogindernagar  Mandi  Kullu  Manali . The route itself made us feel excited that what kind of sights we shall be witnessing all the way.Just about 100 metres away from club house there is a small restaurant called Tibet kitchen on the roadside. we decided to have our lunch at this place. The food was really good .

Manali -- Peace, Tranquility & Snow In Abundance
Post by Samudra | Lucknow | Jun 8, 2006
Manali is almost 575 km from Delhi and takes anything from 14-16 hours non-stop drive. With children or senior citizens plan to stopover midway for the night at Swarghat or Bilaspur [HPTDC Hotels avl] with advance booking. For Rohtang, start early at 0500hrs. to beat the crowd and watch the first golden rays of the sun kiss the mountain peaks. Negotiate hard with the woollen dress shops, sledge and ski rides at Rohtang and the horse rides at Solang Valley. Don't forget to taste the Yak Cheese [Rs.700/kg] at the German Bakery on the Mall.

Manali- Abode of Gods
Post by Aseem | Kolhapur | May 20, 2006
Though flights are available to Bhuntar a place about 50 Kms form Manali, it is accessible by road from Chandigarh or Pathankot. I recommend Pathankot to Manali via Palampur, Baijnath, Jogindernagar, Mandi and Kullu. If you have time you can take a toy train journey from Pathankot to Jogindernagar. It is about 8 hours of relaxed driving through tea gardens, tall pine trees, plenty of small streams till you hit Mandi. From Mandi till Manali you have River Beas roaring in breathtaking rapids along the roadside. Winding road through pines, orchards of apples and exuberance of wild flowers make you feel as if the drive should continue.

Unforgettable memories
Post by Serena | Mumbai | Jun 21, 2012
Manali is best reached by bus from Delhi. An overnight journey is most advisable so that you can make the most of the next day. We wanted to avoid the summer rush and hence opted for a winter holiday when the place is not so crowded. Summer (April-May) is peak season and everything is at its peak - the prices, the crowds etc. the main attraction Rohtang Pass is usually closed in winters other than that you can enjoy everything else at leisure during the december-January months, only remember to carry lots of warm clothes.

Travelling Tips to Khajuraho





Khajuraho - Poetry sculpted on stone - bold and beautiful
Post by Abhijit | Gurgaon | Oct 23, 2010
Avoid the place during extended summer season. Otherwise, the weather is quite pleasant. Avoid the local touts and some of the guides. They seem to over-emphasize the erotic sculptures with added spices. That gets a bit irritating and one actually misses the beauty of the scenes, which can be enjoyed with minimum words. The poetry is already written in the stone and you do not need any interpreter to understand the same. It is best to buy the World Heritage Series book on Khajuraho. The book is by Archaeological Survey of India. That is the best available book for the general tourist. Also, it is worth taking a local taxi-driver, as they know the places well. Without their help, one cannot see the Southern and Eastern group of temples. Remember to see the location of old Khajuraho village and the Ghantai temple. An extended weekend worth spending.

Sculptings that seem better than the DaVinci and Michealangelo, to me.
Post by Suresh | Bangalore | Sep 27, 2010
We went by Rajdhani from Bangalore to Jhansi. The train arrived at 1am on the third day. Our travel agent had arranged a nice A/C car to take us to a hotel in Orchha. Next day, after sightseeing the palaces in Orchha, we left at 12 noon and arrived in Khajuraho at 5pm. In between, there was a lunch stop at a very nice Coffee Shop Restaurant cum Gift Shop, about 60 km from Khajuraho.

Most underrated destination
Post by Prema | Mumbai | Dec 5, 2007
The best time of the year to visit is October to March, when the weather is pleasant. The summers are too hot and not good for sightseeing. Air is the best way to reach. There are daily flights from Delhi of Indian and Jet. Soon Kingfisher too will be starting services. A rail line is expected in 2008 to come right into the town from Jhansi and should improve the connectivity.

Khajuraho Temples!
Post by Sudhir | Noida | Nov 13, 2011
One can go to Khajuraho from Delhi or Mumbai by morning flights which are very convenient. An evening overnight train from Nijamuddin arrives Khajuraho in the morning and is quite convenient.

Mesmerizing temple architecture
Post by Arpit | Ghaziabad | Apr 7, 2013
we travelled on march 2013 from gwalior to khajura via Datia, jhansi...and the road near to Datia and datia to jhansi is NO ROAD at all. it was all under construction and i heard it has been like this for 1 year almost. So in case you are travelling from Gwalior to khajurao - kindly check condition of road near Datia and jhansi and in case it is bad, you can take the route from Gwalior to Shivpuri to khajurao - this road is lengthy by around 100km but shivpuri to jhansi is excellent toll road with 4 lane highway (2 lane each side) and you will finally endup in saving time as compared to travelling at around 10km/hr average over that bad stretch of road and if you do not have a SUV kind of vehicle you always have a risk of car breakdown on that extremely bad road stretch.

Travelling Tips to Orchha





Orchha - a hidden destination
Post by Abhijit | Gurgaon | Aug 12, 2012
Orchha is considered as added bonus during Khajuraho trip  however, it deserves more attention. Monsoon is one of the best times for visit, followed by winter. Summer is definitely avoidable. This takes only 30 minutes from Jhansi railway station. Bhopal Shatabdi is the best option  where you can reach Orchha by 11:30 AM in the morning. During monsoon, sometimes the Betwa River gets overflowing and start flowing above the bridge. Hence, one should avoid crossing the bridge and going to the forest  even when the bridge is accessible.

Orchha means achha
Post by Pradeep | Delhi | Feb 17, 2007
jhansi is nearest railwaystation and airport. Orchha is 20km from jhansi, 15km from jhansi bus stand. Delhi to jhansi satabdi exp is an option and taj express. Taxi or three wheeler bargaining is required. winter is right time to go

Heritage at its best
Post by Arpit | Ghaziabad | Apr 7, 2013
if coming from gwalior do checkout on road before Datia and between datia and jhansi, as we travelled during march 2013 and this was no road at all. It was very very difficult with medium sized hatchback car to commute, as you have to always decide should you put your front wheels or back wheels of car into which pot hole on road. it was actually no road at all. if road is very bad, try to go via shivpuri which will be 100km extra, but road is excellent you will endup saving time at the end and also prevent your car from breakdown.

Travelling Tips to Mandu



MANDU - STILL UNSPOILED
Post by Vinod | Agra | Jul 30, 2011
Travel possible by road only. About 100Km from Indore. If personal vehicle is not available buses ply quite often from Indore. Avoid travelling at night because of the tribal area and hilly road.

Travelling Tips to Ajmer





Holy Ajmer Dargah
Post by Barish kohinoor
Don't rely on the autorickshaw drivers, rickshaw pullers who will forcibly make arrangements for accommodation at Ajmer. You can approach directly to a lot of choices of hotels without a mediator to avoid cheating.
Read full review 







Dargah e Ajmer
Post by Priyanka | Bangalore | Jul 25, 2008
How to Get There:
Best is to take the Delhi-Ajmer Shatabdi. That way you reach Ajmer at noon and after checking in to your hotel/ guest house, you can visit the Dargah in the evening (Best time to be there). There are also Taxis from Jaipur or even luxury buses
Where to Stay:
Luxury lovers should choose Mansingh Palace, Phoolmahal Palace or Roopangarh Fort
For Budget travellers I recommend the RTDC Hotels. These are really good.
Read full review 







Ajmer Dargah
Post by Barish kohinoor
You can reach Jaipur by air. From there you can proceed to Ajmer by train/car/bus which will take around three hours. The best hotel to stay in Jaipur is Hotel Shikha, Opp: Deer Park, behind the Secretariat. At Ajmer reasonably priced good hotels are available close to Dargah. Please avoid mediators like autorickshaw drivers, rikshaw pullers etc- to find any hotel.

Beware of pick pockets..
Post by Pradeep | Aligarh | Nov 10, 2011
From railway station its just 2 km walking distance. Its a very busy place so its better to go by feet instead of rickshaw or auto.One warning for each and every place beware of pick pockets & innocent looking beggars.

Memorable Journey
Post by Himanshu | Delhi | Feb 9, 2013
I traveled from Delhi to Ajmer in Duronto which I find to be best train ever. Try to book your seats well in Advance. At Ajmer you can find local transport at any point of time. Happy Journey.

Alwar Experience
Post by Surajit | Delhi | Jan 20, 2013
Close to Delhi (approx 2 hrs drive). Roads have improved now and the drive is pleasant. You may opt for the Delhi - Jaipur highway or the state highway.

Industrial town 
Post by Ritwick | Kolkata | Jul 6, 2011
This place is 55 km from Delhi airport. The road after Gurgaon is dug up for expansion. Don't travel between 11p.m to 6 a.m since the trucks ply on the road and the road is chock a block at this time.

My cool trip
Post by Anil | Delhi | Feb 25, 2013
It is just a 2 hour travel from gurgaon with a average driving speed around 60-80 and the road conditions are very good other than the daruhera town wherein you may evidence traffic conditions sometimes and rarely at manesar town Do remember the turn wherein you have to take for neemrana industrial area as it is not a clear road but just appears to be a divider rather just 500 meters once you enter Neemrana Industrial area in highway

Travelling Tips to Chittorgarh



Nice place
Post by Manoj  | Bangalore | Feb 9, 2013
Shoes compulsary, good camera with huge battery back up if you are a photography crazy person. Travel you can from anywhere in Rajasthan. Food is oily and fatty, need to keep watch on the calories. Do not shop inside the fort or palace, go to the local market if needed. Hotels are expensive for the quality, service and facility they provide. Food in these hotels are on match with 5 star hotels.

Best way to travel from Bangalore to Jaipur
Jaipur is located at a distance of 1998 km from Bangalore. Jaipur, the Pink City, is well-connected to Bangalore by air, rail and road.
However, the best way to reach Jaipur from Bangalore is by air. You can board any of the direct flights from Bangalore and reach Jaipur in about 4 hours. Almost all airlines operate daily flights from Bangalore to Jaipur. 
Travelling Tips to Jaipur



The Pink Wonder
Post by Suhani | Jaipur | May 19, 2006
Very well connected by road, rail or air, Jaipur is 238 kms from Delhi. Luxury buses ply to and from Jaipur every 2 hours. But for rail or air travel, do get your tickets booked well in advance.

Rasjasthan ka dil
Post by Mona | Faridabad | Dec 7, 2011
While going to Jaipur one must Visit Chowkidhani the typical rajasthani food restraunt.Since while coming back from Jaipur it not a good idea because they serve the food from 6pm onwards -10pm.Also the different foods & snacks in jaipur has more chillies in it than an average person can take so care must be taken while indulding into a lot of food.Jaipur can be reached by Train /car.Flight is not a good idea as its very near. I personally loved the journey from Delhi -Jaipur and back to Delhi in a car with my family.The warning is one must carry the correct route map of the hotel where you will stay ,we really had a hard time finding our hotel in jaipur & landed up at chandpol 4 times in the city. Must take a guide while sight seeing it saves a lot of time and one can cover up al ot of places in as short span.That was Jaipur really 'Rajasthan ka dil'

Historical Jaipur
Post by Wanderlust
And yes, dont forget to bargain with the rickshaw drivers. The cabs and rickshaws are quite quite expensive and one needs to be sharp while dealing with them. So also the coolies. But one cant do much as far as coolies go since the exorbitant rates seem to be premeditated.

So many things to see, but.........
Post by Rohit | Bangalore | May 9, 2008
Jaipur is an extremely tourist friendly place for foreigners, not so for Indians. So be mentally prepared. Credit Card machines do not work if you are an Indian, so carry sufficient cash. For Handicrafts - do visit the Rajasthali only on Ajmeri Gate. The other Rajasthali's are not govt run. The one on Ajmeri gate has a eye popping collection of handicraft. If you are the bargaining type, go to Johari Bazar or the Market opp Hawa Mahal. Keep in mind that the prices quoted are atleast 2 times more than the actual price, so bargain to your hearts content.

Travelling Tips to Jodhpur



Best Tour Of Rajastan.
Post by Captain.ramachandra. | Bangalore | Jan 22, 2013
Winters are heavy. Carry good Sweaters and Jackets. Try to engage taxi. Better to start from Delhi or from Jaipur as the center place for all directions. Better to travel in Feb/March.

Live like a maharaja
Post by Megha | Mumbai | Jan 19, 2013
From Mumbai, suryanagri express or ranakpur express trains which are a good travel, overnight journey. Best would be to fly down, the landscape from the plane is worth a watch. Internal city commute is expensive but I guess that is their sole earnings - tourism.

A drive from Udaipur is comfortable. Winter travel would be recommended like all towns in Rajasthan. Udaipur is connected by air, rail and road from all major cities.

Travelling Tips to Agra



A Journey into the centuries gone by--Destination Agra
Post by Ravi | Gurgaon | May 2, 2006
Agra is well-connected with all major cities of India. You must avoid the summer months as it is extremely hot there. Also beware of touts who will try to take you to particular hotels or shops.

Agra - the place of Taj
Post by Sumit | Kolkata | May 25, 2011
Agra is well connected by train. Agra contonment, Agra fort stations cater to numerous trains. The local Kheria Airport, is not a busy one. The nearest airport for all aspect is New Delhi, about 250 kms. By road, Agra is well connected with Delhi (NH2 & NH8), Jaipur, Gwalior.

Beautiful, Historic City
Post by Vimal | Thiruvananthapuram | Mar 3, 2012
Well connected by Rail, By road to Delhi in 3 hours on the new expressway.
Be careful with your wallets at all time, and footwear when you have to leave it for entering some of the monuments.

City of Taj
Post by Bose | Kolkata | Mar 25, 2009
Best time to travel is in between September and February. Try to reach with enough time in hand to search for a hotel. Be sure to check the tarrif before any transactions.

Dream come true
Post by Pradeep | Bangalore | Nov 24, 2011
Taj is closed on Friday for visitors to make sure you keep this in mind. Best time to see Taj is early in the day, as rays of run fall on the shrine it looks good. As the day goes by it will be difficult as shadow comes in between to take any photo. Nights can get cold so get your gears ready.I feel best time to visit Taj is Feb or early March.

Travelling Tips to Bareilly





A spiritual destination 
Post by Shadab
By Rail/Train
Bareilly falls on the busy Delhi-Kolkata line and is therefore well connected to most of the destinations in Uttar Pradesh and India. The main railway station in Bareilly is Bareilly Cantonment Junction. The junction is well connected to cities like New Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow, Benaras, Jaipur, Kolkata and Mumbai through a cluster of super fast and express trains.
By Road
Bareilly is well connected to cities in Uttar Pradesh and around through a network of National and State Highways. The city has regular buses to destinations like Jaipur, Agra, Mathura, Ghaziabad, New Delhi, Lucknow and Varanasi. Both Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation as well as private parties ply buses to and from the city.

Travelling Tips to Almora



BINSAR - Best Place in Uttaranchal
Post by Anand | Delhi | May 18, 2006
Binsar is about 400 kms from Delhi via Moradabad, Rampur, Udham Singh Nagar, Haldwani, Bhowali, Garampani and Almora. It is 25 kms from Almora on the Bagheshwar Road and 2 kms after Kaparkhan Village. From Almora, there are two roads to approach it. One is the main Bagheshwar Road and the second one goes past the Kasar Devi temple. This road is much more picturesque and is recommended. A forest check post would welcome you at the entrance to the Binsar hill as it is a protected wildlife sanctuary but i wonder if there is much wildlife there apart from birds. The roads are very good, in fact excellent till Almora. It would take about 10-11 hours from Delhi and 4 - 4.5 hours from Haldwani.

Travelling Tips to Auli



Majestic Mountains, Serene Snow and Scorching Sun
Post by Kanchan | Bangalore | Feb 22, 2008
Auli is about 500 kms from Delhi by road through some of the most rugged, mighty and brown mountains you will ever see. The roads are mostly good but downright non-existent at a few places. One can reach Haridwar by an overnight train from Delhi and hire a cab or take the State Transport bus from there to Joshimath. Joshimath to Auli is by the famous cable car  be sure to check the timings for the rides up and down.
A bus is not a good option for people looking for a comfortable drive and if they suffer from mountain sickness. If not this, one can drive all the way from Delhi to Joshimath through Haridwar-Rishikesh-Devprayag-Srinagar-Rudraprayag-Karnaprayag-Nandaprayag-Chamoli and Pipalkoti. You can stop at any of these towns for a roadside meal or a hot cup of spiced tea.
After Rishikesh the entire drive is in the mountains with views along the way to die for. You will find a number of mesmerizing photo-ops on the way. Huge mountains with the Alaknanda giving you company all the way are a feast for the eyes. Devprayag where the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi meet and form the Ganges is a good place to stop. Be sure to walk down to the Sangam and behold this mightiest of Indian rivers.
The entire drive can take around 13 to 16 hrs depending on number of stops and speed. You will need to break journey as driving in the hills is prohibited from 8 pm to 5:30 am.
Warning: Watch out for Land slides! Carry heavy duty woollens during winters  the locals are used to the cold, you are not. Carry a strip of Avomine if prone to mountain sickness.

Auli.... beautiful location after Kashmir in India
Post by Jayshree | Mumbai | Mar 25, 2012
To reach Auli, you have to reach Haridwar, From ther u can either hire share or can hv pvt taxi to reach Joshimath... Form Joshimath by car or rope way.
Be careful As the destination is in top of mountain, local transport is very expensive.. if possible do carry enough money.

AULI ( PARADISE FOR NATURE LOVERS )
Post by Sidharth | Delhi | Feb 9, 2011
Drive from Rishikesh to Joshimath. The drive is about 10-12 hrs depending on the class of vehicle and the roads. From Joshimath there are two alternatives to reach Auli. 1. By road takes about 1.5-2.0 hrs and is about 14 kms, which is quite treachorous. After the winter games probably would have improved. 2. Take the longest ropeway in the world from Joshimath to Auli.

A lifetime gift to yourselves
Post by Shrirang | Aurangabad | Mar 16, 2007
From Haridwar about 280 km, hilly terrain and breathtaking Ghats through out the journey; be prepared for landslides with adequate food and water in case you get stuck up. Although help is easily available, keep emergency phone nos handy.

Travelling Tips to Bhimtal





Bhimtal - A relaxed get-away
Post by Priya | Chennai | Jul 5, 2011
Check the weather conditions first - if you are expecting a hill station like weather, this is not the place. The place is dry and can get hot at times.

Bhimtal: Off the Beaten Track
Post by Ashima | Delhi | Jan 15, 2007
One can travel by road to Bhimtal or [and this is my favourite mode of travel!] take the overnight train, Ranikhet Express till Kathgodam and then take a cab till bhimtal [drive of about 45 minutes]. Negotiate a good rate with the cab person..they are agreeable to charing on a per head basis also and one can share a cab with other people!

Travelling Tips to Binsar



Surreal
Post by Suman | Gurgaon | Sep 4, 2012
October seems like the ideal time to visit Binsar, with clear blue sky, bright sunlight and chilly evenings. One can take a road trip from Delhi which should take 9-10 hours. The roads have been recently constructed and are a joy to drive...

An idyllic getaway
Post by Vasanth | Delhi | Oct 4, 2010
From delhi, one can drive down provided the weather is fine. the roads are in good condition so driving won't be a problem. the distance from delhi is roughly 400 km. Other easier option is to take the overnight kathgodam express and hire a cab from kathgodam. From here, Binsar is roughly 2 hours away. Regular buses also ply from Delhi till Almora.

Whiff of Paradise
Post by Gitanjali | Kolkata | May 31, 2006
Haldwani is best connected by trains to Delhi and dehradoon. Then cars and buses will take you to Binsar. Take warm clothes and wear trekking shoes on the outdoor trips.

A heaven of pine trees.
Post by Noopur
It takes 10-12 hrs by road from Delhi.A better option is to take an overnight train to kathgodam n take a cab from there. takes just a couple of hours from there. Much more comfortable and you save a day.

Away from civilization
Post by Vaderaj | Bangalore | Jun 2, 2011
It is about 30 kms from Almora and 50 kms from Bageshwar. The road from both sides are pretty good but if you are starting from Nainital side and coming to Binsar the roads upto Almora is pretty bad. The rains have torn it apart last year (2010) and will not be fixed this year also. Looks like it will be a couple of years before things are okay. This sector is much better than the Nainital surrounding areas (too many curvy roads).

Travelling Tips to Hemkund



Hemkund Sahib-Valley of Flowers
Post by Amit | Bangalore | Apr 28, 2006
Train to Haridwar. Long road journey to Govind ghat, 22 kms from Joshimath. One day trek to Gangharia. Hemkund is a 3-5 hour trek from Ghangaria. A fairly steep one. Valley of flowers is a 2-4 hour easy trek from Ghangaria. There are plenty of hotels and camping sites at Ghangaria.
Season for this trek is from April-Sept. Porters can be hired at Govindghat, Ghangaria or enroute to help you carry your bags or even you!! People can be transported by a horse/mule, on the back of a porter or even a palaquin kind of structure!
The route is fairly well marked, there are plenty of hikers and devotees taking on the same journey and several small shops selling snacks/food/water/etc.

Travelling Tips to Kausani



A himalayan delight!
Post by Hetal | Mumbai | Apr 16, 2009
We visited Kausani from Nainital and it was a four hour drive through pleasant roads. However, if you are not accustomed to winding roads, it is advisable to take nausea medication beforehand. Kausani can be reached by road from Delhi, or by a few hours drive from Kathgodam railway station. The temperature was average when we visited in March end, but it is advisable to carry light woollen clothes as it can get pretty cold in the evenings and nights.

A fabulous destination
Post by Soumyajit | Delhi | Sep 30, 2012
August, September, October are the best months. Though a hill station, summer can be really warm as it is in a lower altitude than nainital. There is only one SBI atm in the town near the entry of the town. Tourists are better advised to use their atms in Almora. The SBI atm normally has money. However during peak seasons, one cannot guarantee.

Trip to Heaven called 
Post by Watan 
If traveling in Winter, Please carry more than enough woolen than u think. If visiting keeping some adventurous activities in mind, then you will be disappointed but a great place to bust your stress of routine life. Take Ranikhet Express to Kathgodam from Old Delhi Railway station, then a cab to Kausani direct for about 146 kms and enjoy the ride but make sure to keep some pills to prevent 'vomitting' during ride and have them before you start the journey from kathgodam to kausani.

distance from nainital is 120 kms takes 4-5 hours to reach from there by road
avoid travelling in monsoons as area is hilly throughout and landslides are common then

 Kausani
Post by Monika | Delhi | Jun 15, 2012
Its about 5 hrs drive from Rampur and about 4 from Kathgodam but the journey is good. One can take an overnight train from Delhi & reach kathgodam/ Rampur and then have to take a taxi or a bus to reach Kausani.

Travelling Tips to Lansdowne





Scenic Lansdowne
Post by Suranjan | Delhi | Jun 24, 2011
Starting from Delhi->Ghaziabad->Modinagar->enter Merrut city go towards Begumpul take a right turn->carry on till Meerabagh take another right->carry on keeping an eye on Kubhmela Exp. Way on your left, you need not enter Bijnor->Kotdwar-> Duggada->Lansdowne.
Try to carry plenty of water, snacks. Try to complete your breakfast within the Bijnoe stretch. The hilly stretch starts only after Kotdwar.

The clouded land
Post by Madhuri | Mumbai | Oct 10, 2010
To reach Lansdowne, the best way is to take the road from Delhi. The nearest rail-station is Kotdwar, which is almost 2.5-3 hrs away.
During the monsoons, there is good chance of Landslides, and hence advisable to travel in a more powerful car which can resist the strong flows of gushing water which sometime find their way to the road.

Lansdowne - Silent beauty of Valley!
Post by Giri | Delhi | Jul 7, 2009
Please refill fuel at Kotdwar before climbing to Lansdowne. There is no petrol pump at Lansdowne.
here is no restaurants are market around Tarakeshwar temple. Hence, plan it as such you were back to Lansdowne to have your food. Or, carry packed food with you.
You may get fresh seasonal fruits enroute. In July, we got fresh mangoes Rs.15 per kg. near Najibabad on the highway roadside.
In Bijnor Kwality restaurant on the highway is good to have food with family

The Sound of Silence
Post by Ranee | Goa | Sep 22, 2007
Light woolen clothing for summer and heavy woolen garments for winter. Carry rain protection gear in all seasons.
Well-connected by a motorable road - Delhi (295 km.), Haridwar (95 km.) & Dehradun (150 km.). Lansdowne is also linked by a motorable road to almost all the important cities in Uttaranchal. Delhi via Meerut, Mawana, Bijnor, Najibabad, Kotdwar on a good road most of the time! There are many eating places with clean restroom facilities. Crossing over the River Ramganga is awesome.

A perfect weekend getaway from delhi
Post by Nitish | Delhi | Aug 1, 2011
I traveled by Mussorie Express which takes entire night, if you are planning by this train, please get reservations done in 3AC ONLY, Use this mode if you can walk in mountains as it demands lot of walking to see the nature here, else drive to this place, roads between Kotdwar and Lansdown are in good condition.

Travelling Tips to Mukteshwar





Peora in Mukteshwar - serene and peaceful
Post by Abhijit | Gurgaon | Jun 14, 2009
We visited this place on the month of June. We drove from Delhi to Kathgodam and then hired a local driver cum guide. The driver was very knowledgeable about local roads as there are not sufficient road-signs in the village roads. This is a very important aspect on this area. As the roads are generally empty, one might not be able to know the exact route, unless they are familiar with this area.

Peora (off Mukteshwar) a destination less explored
Post by Navin | Mumbai | Oct 24, 2006
Nearest Rail Station is Kathgodam. From there a drive of 85km/2.5 Hrs via Bhawali, Garampani & Kwarab Bridge.
Straight drive from Delhi - 347km/08-09 Hrs via Moradabad, Rampur, Kathgodam, Bhawali & Garampani.
It is situated 23km from Almora and 10km from Mukteshwar on Almora-Mukteshwar road. Nainital is 50km away.
Ranikhet Exp connects Delhi & Kathgodam.

Mukteshwar
Post by Travel Freak | Delhi | Jan 4, 2010
Travel is very simple till Kathgodam, from there just after 5 kms there is a diversion, the staright one goes to Jeolikot-Nainital and the seocnd goes to Bhimtal. I went to Jeolikot (17 kms) and there is a diversion there, the left turn goes to Nainital and the straight (Ranikhet Highway) goes to Bhowali (17kms). From Bhowali take a right turn towards Ramgarh (13kms). From Ramgarh it startight upto Mukteshwar (25kms).
This route is 5kms longer than the Bhimtal one, but very less crowded of vehicles and driving is very easy.
I will recommend to prefer this route while going as it is much easier and the roads are fantastic.

PEORA A HIDDEN DESTINATION
Post by Debendra | Kolkata | Oct 6, 2006
You could drive straight from Delhi or reach Kathgodam by train and then take a car. Do not forget to recharge tank from khairna. Otherwise the nearest filling station will be at Almora.

Travelling Tips to Mussoorie



Mussoorie-Uttranchal visit March 2012
Post by Dharmesh | Mumbai | Mar 30, 2012
The GHAT as we term the road uphill is not in the best of shapes and under going repairs / new drainage lines....hope it gets completed before the vacation rush. Our hotel was Sterling Pine Hills and the direct road to the hotel was closed...hence had to go around a hill to reach our hotel.

Mussoorie-Queen of hills
Post by Jatin | Delhi | Sep 11, 2010
Travel Tips:
One should carry their warm clothes or atleast full sleeve shirts, shawls or caps. You will never be able to predict the weather of this place as most of the time of the year it is chilling and raining. Carrying a raincoat or umbrella would be an added advantage.
How to reach:
Mussoorie is conveniently connected by road to Delhi and major cities. It is called the 'Gateway' to Yamunotri and Gangotri Shrines of Northern India. The closest rail station is Dehradun. Taxis are easily available for Mussorie as are buses at regular intervals.
The best time to visit is from mid-March to mid-November though the downpours could be an inhibiting factor in the monsoon months of July to September.

Mussoorie in the pouring rain
Post by thera | Delhi | Aug 20, 2008
Delhi-Dehradun by Shatabdi train. Taxi to Mussoorie cost me 500 rupees. Hotel Shiva Continental cost me 1250/day and as I did not get a room with a view, shifted to a basic but really cute hotel Luxmount on the Mall road, with probably the best views in town. Check the pix. Oh, room cost was 500/day -bed, wardrobe, dresser, coffee table, 2 armchairs, TV, attached bath with hot and cold water. (No housekeeping service ofcourse!) Perfect for a budget traveller. For meals, visit the nearby restaurants and Coffee Cafe Day.

Travelling Tips to Gulmarg



Beautiful Valleys & Snow Capped Mountains
Post by S.c. | Rourkela | Dec 29, 2011
The place Gulmarg is well connected to Srinagar, which is reachable by air/road from Jammu/Delhi. You can take trains upto Jammu & then can have road drives thru longest tunnel of Asea. Air travel can be from Jammu & while approaching Srinagar, the view of the snow capped mountains will add thrills to you. For outdoor activities out in snow, cover yourself with adequate winter wears which is available for a price. Have snow goggles to avoid the blinding of eyes. Balance yourself while walking/skating on the snow, else the fall will be too much painful or may be worse. Don't talk a lot with each other which will make you to take more breaths & eventually tiring as the mountain air is thin with less oxygen compared to normal places at low altitude. Carry enough medicines for aches,colds & muscle cramps.

If there was heaven
Post by Sowjanya | Hyderabad | May 17, 2011
Gulmarg is a hilly area, so all those with breathlessness and other breathing problems, please ensure to carry your back up's.
As there is a lot to walk and climb, it is adviseble to have light food and warm clothing - as in winters the snow fall is very very heavy - and the strom gets crazy - so be mindful of it :)

Snow at Best !
Post by Hemanta | Bangalore | Mar 10, 2007
One can reach by road, Railway (up to Jammu) or by Air. Private Taxi is plenty. Kashimiri's are friendly people with lot of love, care and hospitality. Terrorism and Terrorist are the problem.

Paradise on earth
Post by Anushka | Mumbai | Mar 21, 2013
Flights are invariable late as weather is unpredictable. From srinagar airport it's almost 2-2 1/2 hrs journey as in winter on snow cladded road one can not drive fast.There is a restriction for private vehicle entry in gulmarg. We have hired travel car from airport which dropped us at the base of gulmarg (I forgot the name of that area), from this point there r sumo's which takes us up in the mountain of gulmarg. this journey is scenic & all these vehicles are driven by locals who are experts in driving on snow cladded road.One has to negotiate on rates. Carry sufficient water, snacks if traveling with kids as very few shops r available on road.

Travelling Tips to Kashmir



Paradise Personified
Post by Poornima | Agra | Jun 28, 2012
Flying is the best option if you book tickets before they touch skies. Train is also a good option if you can bear a day and night journey before you reach there. To go to gulmerg, sonmarg and pahelgoan hire a cab to and fro. It is ideal to reach there by 10am to enjoy the engagements there. The Gondola ride closes at 4pm so it is advisable to leave early for your destinations. To see the local spots in Srinagar, hire an auto, it can take you anywhere and everywhere you want it to.

Truly 'Heaven-on-Earth'!!
Post by Kanupriya | Mumbai | Aug 6, 2008
The best mode to travel is to take a flight from Delhi to Srinagar. And from Srinagar, you can hire a car for further travel. We first went to Jammu from Delhi to visit the Vaishno Devi Temple and from Jammu, we went by car to Srinagar. Believe me, the journey was really painful. A person with motion sickness just cant go through it. It took around 10 hours in the hills. So, it is preferable to go by flight.
Hotels are available suiting all budgets. You can stay at any one near the Dal Lake in Srinagar. Houseboats are also available in Dal lake but, they are quite smelly. In Pehalgam though, finding a hotel is difficult. Mostly small lodges are only there.
Kashmir has become very safe for tourists. So, there isnt anything to worry about. Hope you enjoy your trip!!

Trip to Jannat........Kashmir
Post by Viral | Pune | Jun 7, 2012
It's a wonderful time to visit Kashmir between 15th May to 15th June. You can visit all the places during this time. Snow is also available in Gulmarg & Sonmarg. Just make sure to book the hotels in advance as it's a vacation time and lots of people visits during this time.

Awesome Kashmir - truely heaven on earth
Post by Piya | Bangalore | Aug 23, 2012
We went by air from bangalore to srinagar and from there you get local cabs which will tk you to all the places. average they take 2500Rs per day for each location from Srinagar.
hotels are not a problem in srinagar but other places someties needs advance booking as few in number.

Heaven on Earth
Post by Mehul | Mumbai | Nov 16, 2011
It is important to check if at all there are any tensions in valley, if not even after traveling to Kashmir you should avoid going to terror prone area & strictly follow advice of your guide.For reaching to Kashmir from Mumbai you can book train tickets in Jammu Tawi which is direct train to Jammu & from there on its 8-9 hours road journey which is very scenic but equally tiring due to winding roads.
To avoid journey at a stretch you can take night halt at Patnitop which is very pleasant place & you will start getting a feel of kashmir.Avoid traveling during night.In case of flight you can travel from Mumbai to Srinagar which will be less painful & tickets are around 6-7,000 in case you book them in advance.

Travelling Tips to Katra



Katra - Base to heaven on Earth!
Post by HimanshuG | Delhi | Jun 1, 2006
Its well connected to Jammu by regular buses/jeeps, which is itself well connected by air/rail/road.
There are helicopter services from jammu to vaishnodevi as well, so the senior citizens can comfortably do their pilgrimages.
It gets pretty cold in winters, so keep that in mind.

Our memorable vaishno devi darshan
Post by Jayashree 
The best way to reach katra from anywhere is to get to Delhi and from delhi to Jammu. from Jammu there are taxis and buses plying to katra. Buses take 3 to 4 hours and taxis take 2 to 3 hours to reach katra. from katra vaishno devi darshan can be had by trekking up 14 km or by using dholi or pony. though when we went, due to bad weather the helicopter was not operating, this is the best option to avoid body ache and to save time. helicopter flies from katra to the bhawan and bookings for this can be done and this facility may be utilised.
Regarding travel warnings, only fear is landslide during bad weather

Katra/Vaishno Devi Yatra.
Post by Sanjay | Ghaziabad | Nov 15, 2011
Some of the unpleasent experience i wish to share-
1 Always negotiate/verify the rates of poni/palki/ghora etc.I have been cheated during the trip.
2 from Jammu to Katra,if some one wants taxi,pl negotiate with them since We have been cheated during the trip.may be discussed more on telephone.
3 I fsome body is hiring ghora from Katra,he should opt helicopter service which is cheaper.

Jai Mata Di
Post by Deepika | Delhi | Dec 4, 2012
We usually travel by train from Delhi till Jammu and from there hire a taxi / bus. Katra is approx 1.5 hours away from Jammu. One should always carry woollens even in summers due to hilly area and uncertainty of weather.

Travelling Tips to Ladakh (Leh)





Heaven on earth
Post by Kartik | Delhi | May 10, 2008
One can travel by road via the Manali-Leh or Srinagar-Leh highways or take a flight to the Leh airport.
Carry a lot of warm clothes and be prepared for temperatures to plummet rapidly, especially when it becomes cloudy.
A word of caution  one should always take time to acclimatize to the surroundings. The first few hours in Leh should be spent sleeping or resting and relaxing, and only in the evening should one venture out to nearby areas. A full days rest in Leh is ideal. One should also avid exertion of all kinds, and if required take adequate rest.
One should also carry all possible medicines that may be required for the journey. Food is scarce and there are very few eating places in these areas, so adequate snacks and food items should be carried along. Intake of sufficient amount of water is essential and it makes sense to stock enough at the beginning of the road journey.
The routes to the passes are some times covered with slippery ice and one should be sure of the road conditions before planning travel to these areas.
Having said this, Ladakh is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places on earth and is definitely a must-see for all.

Ladakh- The lunar paradise
Post by Giridharan | Thane | Jan 12, 2007
Reach: Air: from Delhi & Jammu. Road : from Srinagar or Manali.
Travel tips: Air travellers need 6-7 days of aclamatisation/ 3 days for road travellers. Drink lot of fluids. Oxygen levels are low. Take remedial medicines. One can take help from Army/ B.R.O detachments and MI rooms, in case of health needs. Proper authorisation to visit tourist sites need to be procured from Leh.
Warning: Advanced planning need to be meticulously done as the might of the mountain is very much visible; the itinerary might be thrown out of gear anytimes due to erratic weather changes. May need 3 weeks for satisfactory trip. Follow cautionary signs.

Magnificiant Leh
Post by Girish | Delhi | Nov 16, 2012
Please intake lot of water.
for first 2 days relax and take adequate sleep
don't allow yourself to get dehydrated. Many people take the water thing too far, imho.
Avoid alcohol if you are planning to trek. Also coffee. But tea is fantastic and plentiful.
Wash hands before and after meal with soap. Probably the most important tip. There are wash sinks in the restaurants and foreign tourists hardly ever use them but the locals do.
Buy your water from the two boiled water shops. Just ask people where they are when you get there. Its cheaper than bottled water too and will help keep the plastic rubbish problem down.
If trekking, take some alchol hand gel for hand washing in places where the conveniences are limited. Use detergents when you wash your dishes, but don't put them in the streams. Take the water away from the stream to rinse off your plates. Do not put any soapls or detergents in the streams.
Do not leave any rubbish, however small in the environment. Burn it or take it back to town.
Take usual small travellers first aid kit.
Take lip balm, sunblock, decent hat (not a cap) to prevent sunburn and dry skin.
I can't comment on the weather with any precision. Someone else will or do a search.

Very near to the abode of peace
Post by Krishna | Kolkata | Jun 30, 2012
One must be very careful about high altitude sichness. One must take rest for atleast 48-72 hours with plenty of water 3-4 litres a day. As there is scanty of oxygen content in the air. You can reach there by air from Delhi or by road either from Manali or Srinagar.

Out of the World
Post by Nikhil | Mumbai | Jun 26, 2012
One should travel via Manali & should conclude enroute Kargil to Srinagar. One should carry heavy woolens, sun glasses, sun screen lotion, dry fruits for the personal use. One should drink minimum 3 litters of water daily to get oxygen & to keep oneself safe as oxygen is very low due to high altitude. People advice for high altitude medicines to carry but I will say only water drinking is the biggest safety for anyone. One should walk slowly after reaching, avoid tobacco as it obstruct your breathing power & also avoid alcohol as it dehydrates the body & again it makes difficult for the body to get the oxygen. One should also keep camphor to grow the breathing power.

Travelling Tips to Nubra Valley





Hunder & Diskit of Nubra valley
Post by VRV | Mumbai | Jul 15, 2011
Nubra is about 160 kms and car / private taxi takes about 5-6 hours to reach.
On the way, you pass through the snow laden Khardung La pas- the world's highest motorable road at over 18350 ft above sea level.Carry warm clothes if you wish to stop at Khardung La where you also find only one restaurant serving tea, Maggi and Momos.

Nubra valley is far from Leh city. If you book hotel in Leh you can't travel to Nubra valley on in single day. You need to make arrangement for accommodation while visiting Nubra valley.

Travelling Tips to Pahalgam





Pahalgam the Switzerland of India
Post by Parveen  | Bangalore | Jun 1, 2011
We need to hire a vehicle from Jammu to Patnitop and then to Pahalgam. This Journey will be enchanting with beautiful valleys, waterfalls, snowcapped mountain ranges etc. 
Read full review 







A Heavenly Experience!!
Post by Ankita | Nagpur | May 29, 2011
At the Srinagar airport, there are pre-paid taxis charging Rs. 1200-1500 (non-AC/AC). From there it's a hassle-free journey devoid of ghats on good roads through scenic locations and saffron fields. You can also buy the world-famous Kashmiri saffron and cricket bats made from Kashmiri willow it on your way. Ask your cab-driver for a good deal. The food served at dhabas is not good, just stop for tea/ snacks. Pack a sweater or two, yeah, even the summers are cold by the rest of India standards! A windsheeter would be best to fight the chilly winds, especially if you wanna go out in the evenings or night. Normal clothing will suffice for the day or if you stay indoors. Bargain with the shawl-wallahs and horsemen. They tend fix exorbitant prices. During river-rafting, you have to sign an undertaking saying that you are participating at your own risk. Please do not take kids below 10 as they are not covered in the undertaking.

Tiny Heaven on Earth
Post by Sumit | Kolkata | Mar 20, 2012
Pahalgam is only about 95 km from the Srinagar and about 255 km from the nearest major rail station Jammu. Srinagar is well connected from Delhi & Jammu through frequent flights. Jammu is also well connected from all the major cities. Journey from Jammu to Pahalgam takes about 8-9 hours while that from Sringar is 2-2.5 hours. Frequent bus services and private cars are available from both the places.

The sheer beauty of Pahalgam
Post by Mehul
Pahalgam can be reached from Srinagar in about 2-2.5 hrs.....in between, one can halt at pampore to appreciate the saffron plantations, then at Avantipore to see the ancient ruins....next halt at sangam to buy some genuine Kashmiri willow bats and finally a short detour from anantnag takes one to the hindu sun temple and ruins of Martand...all these places are definitely worth a short visit...

The Switzerland of India
Post by Parveen  | Bangalore | Jun 4, 2011
It is better to travel Pahalgam after doing the sight seeing of Jammu and Patnitop. The route to Pahalgam via Patnitop is awsome with deep valleys, streams, water falls, view of snow capped ranges etc.

Travelling Tips to Pangong



Pangong
Post by Rakhee
Leh is well connected by flights from Delhi, Jammu and Srinagar. The frequency and timings differ with each route and with each operating Airlines and it may also change during on and off season...
Who have breathing problem or asthma should avoid to visit this place. One should carry small cylinder of oxygen for emergency( not compusory) as lake of proper oxygen. take rest at least for 24 hrs to condition our selves with climate of that place.

Surreal Beauty
Post by Hasan jawaid | Delhi | Aug 8, 2012
From Leh you can take a taxi to Pangong. Take a rugged vehicle for you would be riding on some very bumpy and bouncy terrain. Prepare well to ward off mountain sickness, for you would be travelling through the world's third highest motorable road -- the Changla Pass. Keep some medicines and eatables ready. Do not spend too much time on the Changla Pass, the air is thin and it is very cold, even in June. Keep warm clothes for Pangong too. It gets very cold in the evenings.
Be prepared to take hundreds of photographs. So, keep spare storage (memory cards etc) with you.

Travelling Tips to Patnitop



Patnitop a quiet paradise
Post by Ajay | Jammu | Apr 23, 2007
You can get a deluxe bus or a private taxi from Jammu. On way Rs.1000. Hotels range from 500 to 2000. If you want to stay in Govt. accommodation choose only dak bungalow rooms (800) or deluxe huts on the main site (1800-3000). Do not go to background huts. These are shabby. Bargain with the hotels. they may be cheap than what they ask.

Earth meets heaven!
Post by Sapna  | Ghaziabad | Dec 27, 2011
You can reach over there by road transport like bus, car.If travelling makes you nauseatic than prefer to have pills with you.Woollen clothes are also must during winters.

Incredible India! 
Post by Prerna
Don't forget to hire a Taxi either from Jammu or from Katra .We paid 4000 for the Taxi from Katra for two days in Patnitop and back to Jammu including sight seeing(Natha top,Sanasar in Patnitop,and Manser Lake on Udampur-Jammu highway).Good restaurants but if you choose a cottage then you can cook your self.Don't forget to take some ready to cook,tea bags and fun time.

Post by Dhanvesh | Delhi | Mar 21, 2013
If a person go to Maa Vashnodevi, that make a short trip to Patrnitop. It is just 90 KM and hire a local conveyance such as car and take wollen during winter season

Travelling Tips to Sonamarg



Good to see
Post by Ramanujabhattar | Hyderabad | Aug 2, 2012
1,Carry good gloves, which are not available at SONAMARG.Others charges windcheater/coat,gumboots are available on rent. When we go to the GLACIER due to the extreme cold fingures become numb and since we,the travelers have no experience we tend to fall down and after the fall hands simply will not cooperate.
2.Don't expect any food at this place. Go prepared. While going back to
Srinagar also, the food available at most of the places is very bad.
3. Bargain while taking ponies(horses),cars on rent. You have no fixed rents in this place.

Travelling Tips to Srinagar



Wonderful and an Exotic destination
Post by Pranav
It is advisable to do only window shopping one first day and then decide the worth of any item for yourself.
Avoid purchase on houseboats on day 1st of travel as they will be somewhat costleir, unless u are aware of market rates in advance.
Bargain on any item may range from 20-35% of the mentioned cost, except on fixed price shops, though we observed that 2-3 shops of fixed price were too unreasonable and had elevated prices upto 40-50%.
Dont bring too many cherries boxes in handbags on airport, as only one box per person is permssable. Indeed one can keep as many cherry boxes in their suitcases.
Strictly avoid carrying handbags for in flight travel as one will go a rigrous checking with consumption of lots of time on Srinagar airport. One may keep their valuables, cash and milk bottles of children in one handbag.
On the day of return from srinagar through Flight, leave your hotel atleast 3 hours before for airport (especially if u are with family) as there is rigrous checking (of all the luggages and individuals) at one point before airport (leading to Jams and excessive rush) and at 2-3 points inside airport. On an average a family may need atleast one hour inside the airport only to reach final clearance point.

srinagar- god's created valley heven
Post by Shaila | Mumbai | Feb 22, 2007
I took flight from mumbai-delhi-srinagar and back . However direct flights are also there. Be ready for many security checks in Srinagar. Otherwise it is safe provided you avoid roaming at late nights. Lal gate area has a very beautiful temple of shiva and godess [mata]

Gulmarg cable car
Post by Sankaraiah | Hyderabad | Oct 22, 2012
1. Better buy tickets in the Net.
2. Warm clothing, Gloves, shoes required
3. At 2nd stage, do not try to climb further more on foot to see LOC , it is a very difficult terrain.
4. Aged above 50, better to confine to stage one.
5. Carry light food.

Tour to kashmir
Post by Inderjit | Amritsar | May 30, 2012
Always start early and reach early.... I travelled by road. My first night stay was at Patnitop. The Hotels r expensive compared to the facilities.... better option is to stop at KUD that comes 4-5 km before patnitop.... you will get cheaper hotels.....if you reach at night they charge you more.
Second day in travelling to srinagar.....third day to gulmarg......again mind you that you must start early to get tickets for GONDOLA ride....and better take tickets upto the last point ...that will be Rs 800 per person.
fourth day to phelgam and chandanwari...... on the way you can enjoy rafting....fifth and sixth day can be kept for srinagar...dal lake....gardens...forts and monuments and shopping ofcourse......
Avoid taking shortcuts.....keep sufficient fuel in ur car.....Ask for guidance and help from police personnels ....they are really friendly and helpful.... Happy Touring.

A Blissful Stay
Post by Santosh | Hyderabad | Mar 13, 2013
Just have your own vehicle as the public transport system is either abysmal or absent. Roads are in excellent condition specially the Naya Raipur sector and also travel with a guide or with a Navigator fitted to the vehicle as the Naya Raipur sector has deserted roads and one can easily lose his way.

Travelling Tips to Konark





Poetry in Stone
Post by Dipendra | Guwahati | Mar 14, 2007
It takes just about an hour or so from the capital of Orissa by road and the road condition is good. On the way one can take a break at PIPLI, where one gets a chance to satisfy one's hearts desire one seeing and buying a spectrum of APPLIQUE WORK, which involves cutting of colourful fabrics in the shape of flowers, birds and animals and then stitching them artistically on coloured cloths. The most sought after items are Colourful canopies and Garden Umbrellas.

Awe-inspiring architecture or Verses written in stone ?
Post by HimanshuG | Delhi | Jun 15, 2010
Konark is around one and half hour drive away from the well-connected capital of Orissa - Bhubaneswar, through good smooth roads along the very green and welcoming Orissa hinterland and villages.
On the way, the Ashokan rock edict and the Shanti Stupa at Dhauli can be visited, where emperor Ashoka renounced violence and wars after the battle of Kalinga. The view from the stupa of the area around it is simply breathtaking and marvelous.
On the way, further down to Konark, a short break can be taken at the Pipli village, for having a look/shopping for the various handicrafts, and items made using Appliqu work(patch work in bright colors), for which Pipli famous.
Apart from that, the best place to stay in Konark is the Panthnivas Yatri Niwas, which can allow one to visit Konark at sunrise time :)

Travelling Tips to Puri





The soul of the soul of India
Post by Dipendra | Guwahati | Jan 15, 2007
Bhubaneswar ,the capital of Orissa, is just about two hours drive from Puri , the railroad taking about half an hour less. Bhubaneswar is well connected by the railroad as well by air to all the state capitals of india as well as to the national capital of Delhi. Since the call of the sea is irresistible here ,it is best to stay in a hotel near the sea beach so as to facilitate a fast bath in fresh water after a session in the saline waters .

PURI- In my eyes
Post by Purna
Take a train from Bhubneswar . Its just one and half an hour journey . If you are coming form far then it is better to take a train from your city or any bigger city nearer to your place . Like If are from Assam then its better to take a train from Guwahati or else you can come down to Kolkata and can change the train.

Ever interesting destination
Post by Santa | Kolkata | Jun 10, 2011
Best time - Winter. If you are adventures, then visit in Moonsoon. It is well connected by Train from all over India. Nearest Airport - Bhubaneswar (around 55 km away).
Beware of - Hotel pimps,hired car driver. Like other pilgrims not to flash moneys.
Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the Temple.
It's impossible to describe Puri in few word. In fact it needs a book to write about Puri.
JAI JAGANNATH !

Land of Sri Jagannath
Post by Sumit | Kolkata | Apr 30, 2011
Puri is well connected by train from Howrah. All the major South bound trains hals at Bhubaneshwar, the nearest junction and airport ( around 70 kms). Being the state capital, Bhubaneshwar is also connected by train from New Delhi and Chennai. Flight frequencies, although, are not that much.

Post by Ananda | Kolkata | Jun 25, 2006

Travelling Tips to Santiniketan



Our trip to Vishwabharti Shantiniketan
Post by Shoma | Kolkata | Apr 28, 2012
There are dozens of wonderful trains that take you from Howrah in Kolkata directly to Santiniketan in ac chair cars or non-ac compartments. It takes around two and a half hours and these trains like Viswabharati Express generally stick to the timings and are not delayed.
If one wants to attend either of the two festivals - the Spring Festival at Holi or the Poush Festival in end-December, one would have to book a hotel at least a year in advance because every single room is filled much in advance. But the rates are doubled during festive time. The languages spoken are Bengali, Hindi and English and some dialectical Bengali. Food is mainly non-vegetarian but one can get dosas and idlis if one wishes to partake of veg fare. For spring, one thin warm sweater would do but for Poush Festival, one needs to carry very heavy woolens.

A Place I would like to come again
Post by Harish | Delhi | Mar 26, 2011
Santiniketan is well connected by Rail & Road. There are many trains available from Sealdah & Howrah. Journey time is just 2 and a half hours. By road journey also takes almost the same time.

A Memorable Trip to Shantiniketan
Post by Rittika  | Kolkata | Dec 19, 2012
You can reach via train which is available from Howrah. It takes about 3 hours. A/C compartment available. It is better to visit this place during the winters.

Far away from the madding crowd
Post by Tutul | Kolkata | Oct 31, 2011
Tourists from outside Bengal should come to Kolkata and take the Santiniketan Exp, which runs all 7 days. Starts at 10:10 am from Howrah and reaches santiniketan at 12:30 pm. While returning the same train starts at 1:10 pm and reaches Howrah at 3:30 pm. There are a number of other long distance train that runs via santiniketan, hence one can choose any of these trains too.

Travelling Tips to Murshidabad



A travel back in history
Post by Deeptendu | Kolkata | Jan 1, 2013
From Kolkata, take the Hazarduari Express.
Stay in Hotel Manjusha by the Ganges.
WARNING: Hotel Manjusha is the only hotel in Murshidabad where you can spend your time watch the Ganges flow idly by from your hotel verandah. Opt for rooms 201 to 204 if you can. The hotel is usually booked in advance on weekends, so plan ahead.

Travelling Tips to Asansol



OUR TRIP TO ASANSOL 
Post by Biswajit | Kolkata | Nov 2, 2012
The Asansol City is nice enough that any can enjoy and will have a good experience to stay here.
However should have to be aware the bus routs and time-tables and you could not enjoy the evening till late nite.
It is well conneted with bus routs with NH-2 and RAIL routs with Easter Railways (Howrah-Delhi Routs).

Daman-Not Much to See
Post by Rajesh | Mumbai | May 27, 2011
Good connectivity via Roads as well as Rail, nearest train station is Vapi.

Book your hotels well in prior and if you are going to bath in Jampore beach then be ready to take a VERY COLD FRESH WATER shower. The fresh water of the shower IS EXTREMELY ICE COLD. You even might get headache.

Travelling Tips to Anjuna Beach



World famous Beach with a unique History

Because of its pleasant climate, Anjuna can be visited at any time of the year. However, tourists should beware the heavy rainfall between June and October. November to February is the best time to visit Anjuna.

Goa vacation with friends
Post by Sundeep | Bangalore | Dec 26, 2012
Goa is well connected by road/rail/air so it should not be a problem to get there, the resort is very close to the Anjuna beach so it should not be a problem to locate it.
Directions : Take the road to Anjuna from Calangute/Baga, At a circle just before the beach take the right that goes towards Vagator. On the left you will spot a super market, take the immediate left after this market and you reach the resort.
Warnings : Avoid the monsoons for this kind of a vacation and thats it!

Feel like a Goan there!
Post by Ganeshkumar | Chennai | Dec 6, 2012
Don't travel on 2nd October, since it was Gandhi day you won't even get a beer. Because once i landed on the same day and gone dry. But fortunately Dry-day over by night 10PM.
Otherwise warning: If i happened to be there be cautious girls! :)

Travelling Tips to Baga



The truth about Baga
Post by Evaluator
All watersports. However do not expect to find the international fibre glass speed boats in Goa. You will get jet ski, para sailing etc etc... but remember Goa beaches do not have a coral reef, therefore there is no lagoon and water depth may change from shallow to 20 ft or more suddenly.
Railhead from anywhere, try to stop at Thivim, its closer to Baga. Always book prepaid taxis at the exit of the railway station, safer and less rip off. Do not try the motorbike taxis!
Airport in dabolim.
By road, NH17 from Mangalore or Pune

Go Go Goa!
Post by Udaibir | Bangalore | Mar 5, 2011
Goa is very tourist friendly and safe. One can get to Goa via, train, bus or air. remember the best time to be in Goa is from October end to late February. The rates are also higher during the peak season.
The Xmas and New Year carnival is not to be missed at all.

Xmas & New Year 2010/2011
Post by Maria | Panjim | Jun 7, 2011
Easy to reach - beware of the huge potholes in the 'pavements' when walking around at night. Sea very rough at Baga beach at certain times. There are lifeguards now - take notice!!

Gooaaaa
Post by Shravani | Hyderabad | Feb 13, 2013
If traveling in summer, carry only very light clothing as it will be extremely humid. Lots and lots and lots of waterproof sunscreen.
If traveling in the monsoon dont forget your waterproofing gear. You still need sunscreen.
always wear light clothes while going to play in the beach. jeans tends to be heavy when wet :)

Calangute- Baga Beach - Goa
Post by Surej | Bangalore | Apr 28, 2006
You can travel by train- Bangalore to Vasco but Calangute by Bus via Panjim gets ardous . So travell Sleeper Bus from Bangalore - Panjim then bargain with a taxi for Rs.200 to Calangute. Then shack up in any of the small hotels.
All such places cater to the European needs i.e clean toilet and clean beds and are cheap Rs 250 - 350 per day. A little bit of preference is given by the hotels restaurants staff to the foriegn tourists - so if you do tip as most Indians Dont - then on the second meal you can see the changes.
Calangute is not a safe beach, deep. so use Baga .

Experience in the beach of Goa During Monsoon
Post by Max | Delhi | Jul 28, 2009
By Air:
Goa is well connected with all the major cities in India. Airport is in Vasco.
By Rail:
There are lots of train to Goa from Delhi. Goa Express, Mangla Lakshdweep Exp., Goa Sampark Kranti Exp. and lots more. Major stations are Madgaon, Vasco, and Thivim. Anyone travelling to Calangute beach should stop at Thivim station and hire taxi outside the station to reach Calangute. There is a pre-paid booth outside the station where you need to pay approx. Rs. 350 to reach Calangute.
Goa is the god of all destinations and anyone can visit anytime in Goa but I would still suggest that Goa is best avoided during the monsoons.

full of activities
Post by Anita | Delhi | Mar 13, 2007
Depends where you stay, like from delhi, taking direct flight is the best, but if you have time and budget then you can go in GOA express too. from bombay so many flights are available ...

Travelling Tips to Candolim Beach



Candolim Capers
Post by Ken
Driving standards are very different from those in Europe and will be frightening at first but there is some method in all the chaos and you soon get used to it. Taxis are inexpensive and everywhere. I would strongly advise against hiring cars, scooters or bikes - it's just too dangerous.
Goans are open, friendly people and it's impossible to leave without having made some special friends and lasting memories.

Candolim Beach holiday in March
Post by Ravikiran | Pune | Dec 15, 2011
If you happen to take a flight to Goa, Candolim is appx. 30 Km drive from Dabolim airport.It has a good road connectivity from Mumbai and Pune if you love to drive. Margoa railway junction is well connected to most rail routs. If you happen to travel in sunny months like I did, do carry enough summer clothing as you may not get a chance to use local laundry service or to dry your cloths. Its better to carry enough shorts, light three fourth trousers and lots of T- shirts in summer.While visiting the beach do ask for towels from the hotel.You can use Candolim as a central hub to visit nearby Calangut, Baga beaches and other north Goa destinations.

Your best to stick with one taxi driver as you build up good friendship and get good price for your loyalty but they may want you to go to a jewellery store for 10 mins so they can get free fuel but you dont have to buy

(GOA) Garden of Adam n eve!
Post by Clayten | Mumbai | Dec 12, 2011
We had great fun when we went for sighting seeing in North and south goa. The beautiful beaches, forts and the water sports that this place has to offer.It was quite easy for us to travell too, since the resort had a bus for the same and most important a comfortable drive throughout the day. Yes you do have to abide to the warnings at various heritage places and to certain point on every beach. (After all rules made to be broken), but thats totally wrong we need to follow the instructions and avoid from having any bad experience to come across whenever we are traveling to a place like Goa.

Candolim Beach-The Experience
Post by Vidhya | Hyderabad | Nov 16, 2012
A taxi will take you there from the airport and may cost you around 500 rupees or more depending on the season. Do NOT go to calungute as it is very crowded and stuffy. Hit the beach as soon as you freshen up. Great place to relax or explore.

Travelling Tips to Chapora



Dil Chahta Hai!!
Post by Nikhil | Bangalore | May 20, 2006
One will probably have to come here via local bus, hire a vehicle and drive down to the fort.
Make sure you wear your sport shoes while visiting this place, because you will have to climb the hill for about 10 minutes to reach the fort.

Travelling Tips to Colva





Uncrowded beach
Post by Vaderaj | Bangalore | Feb 18, 2011
Nothing much to be scared of. Just be yourselves and ward off advances of hawkers and bike lenders by not responding to them (if you are not interested in getting one for yourselves). Adhere to coast guards suggestions and warnings and do not take lightly the sea water undercurrents.

colva-made simple
Post by Banani | Delhi | Feb 9, 2011
From the airport take a pre-paid taxi at rs 650. The drivers are all probably wannabe pilots so tell them to keep on the road and leave the airspace to the airlines people. I did not know that these guys could fly a Qualis. Absolutely amazing. The Toyota guys should be proud. Seriously tell them that you are not in a hurry.

Viva La Goa....
Post by Sourav
Do carry a long white towel to cover yourself as the heat and the sun rays will burn your skin. for the ladies, applying sunscreen having atleast SPF-30 is a must. carry shades, long hats. the sea water and the sand are a bit coarse, hence it is advisable to wear a t-shirt while you go inside the water.
From the bus stand or from the railway station, keep in mind that the auto-rickshaw doesn't charge you more than Rs 150. if they do, please negotiate.
Enjoy....

goa trip
Post by Rahul  | Ahmedabad | Jan 8, 2013
Dont rely on the riskshaw or taxi wala's especially in the midnight abt the rent, as their rate's are 4times, so, i think bus facilities are the good option from railway station or from bus stand.

Travelling Tips to Dholavira



Experience Ancient Civilisation & Bird Watching
Post by Dhiraj | Pune | Nov 21, 2011
(1) Connectivity - You need to have your own vehicle, as there is no local transport available. State Transport Bus is available from Bhuj to Dholavira (Bus stand), but then there is no local transport from Bus stand to Toran resort & excavated site, museum etc.
(2) Resort Booking - Need to book rooms in advance at Gujarat Tourism offices. Online booking facility is not available.
(3) Do carry snacks & water bottles along, as you probably won't find them beyond Rapar (90 Kms. before Dholavira enroute).
(4) There is no other hotel or restaurant in Dholavira i.e. Toran Resort is the only choice.

Travelling Tips to Bhuj





Real Value for Money
Post by Ashok | Indore | Feb 20, 2011
Bhuj has a railhead and an airport, though we drove from Indore,which made it easier and convenient to extensively cover the whole of Kutch!
One needs prior police permits to visit The Great Rann.
These are easily and quickly made available.

Visit to white desert
Post by Gora
To reach Bhuj from Mumbai there is Mumbai- Bhuj flight. You can come from Mumbai to Bhuj via train also. For Delhi or people from north or east, best way to come to Ahmedabad and then go via rail or road. It is better to go during winter. Summer is quite hot.

Splendid place to explore Kutchh
Post by Mihir | Ahmedabad | Jan 24, 2013
In-spite of being very remote one should not miss visit to Dholaveera.
While going from Ahmedabad you can first visit Dholaveera and reach Bhuj by night if you have started as early as 5.00 in the morning.
You might happen to watch big colonies of Flamingos on the way.

Nice place.
Post by Vineeta 
For people wanting to see Dholavira a sign should be put on the highway for the turning, so that one can visit it before going to Bhuj. We went by road and it was a lovely journey cause the roads are super and we did'nt get lost anywhere.

Travelling Tips to Gondal



Great Royal experience
Post by Girish | Gandhinagar | Jan 28, 2013
Take a good SUV or heavy car like Toyota Innova if u can as the driving can be a little aggressive in these parts. In summer months always use a air conditioned car.

Travelling Tips to Ajanta & Ellora





way more than just caves...
Post by Divya | Delhi | May 25, 2006
Its best to take a maharashtra state tourist bus from aurangabad or other towns from where they operate, especially if u're travelling alone. Summer time dont forget to carry a hat and water bottle. hats are available there, but expensive. do buy one if u forget to take along because the heat is killing. keep sipping water as you walk.

Amazing Ajanta and Excellent Ellora
Post by Amitra | Thane | Feb 6, 2013
Have powerful torch as the caves are quite dark inside. Photography with flash/ tripod is not allowed. Avoid shoes with lace for frequent on and off. Cover Ajanta during first half as the caves are east facing. Have sufficient water and food at the parking bay of Ajanta as nothing is available at the cave upstairs. Be aware of honey bee caves around as at times they get annoyed.
Aurangabad is well connected with the rest of the country in all three ways  Air, Rail and Road and you could search on internet that suits your needs. We travelled from Mumbai and found the following is the best option.
17057 Devagiri Express Daily Mumbai (CSTM) 21.05 Aurangabad (AWB) 04.05, 12 stops, 7 hours, 274km, 3AC  Rs.503. 17618 Tapovan Express Daily AWB 14.35 CSTM 22.05, 12 stops, 7 hour 30 minutes, CC  Rs.403

Ellora caves only.
Post by Feline | Bangalore | Nov 9, 2010
One thing to note is Ajanta caves face the east so visit them in the first half of the day as there is no lights inside. Ellora caves face the west so visit them in the second half of the day. Also make sure on which day the Cave is closed. One day of the week the caves will be closed. Preferable to keep a torch with you when you visit the caves. Some places are dark as there is no electricity in there. Note : Covering Ajanta and Ellora caves in one day is very very difficult considering the distance and walking to do. Best is schedule 3 days for A'bad. 1st day Ellora / Ajanta, 2nd day other spots in A'bad so you get some rest, 3rd day Ajanta / Ellora. This would be ideal.

Ajanta & Ellora: No frills trip (only caves)
Post by Shubham | Mumbai | Apr 20, 2009
Note that Ajanta is about 1 hour from Jalgaon while Ellora is about 45 mins from Aurangabad. Ajanta and Ellora are about 2 hours apart. so, if you are dependent on a train, then you might want to see things in the order Jalgaon-Ajanta-Ellora-Aurangabad, or vice versa.
Also note that if you are going there from Mumbai, then the frequency of trains is more for Jalgaon than from Auarangabad.
wht i did was, i went from mumbai to jalgaon, reached there at 6.30 am after an overnight (6.5 hr) train journey.From Jalgaon railway station i took a rickshaw to the state transport bus stand. It was a 1 hour drive from Jalgaon bus stand to Fardapur, when u get off the bus in Fardapur, there is an MTDC resort bang opposite the road. We checked in there and freshened up. Ajanta caves is 5 mins rickshaw ride, rs. 40 for an entire rickshaw you hire, from the resort.Ajanta opens at 9 am. So we reached ajanta by 9.30 am. Went throught the caves in detail. We were done by about 12.30. Eating at the ajanta cafeteria was a better idea than in the MTDC resort, because the restaurant in MTDC reort had very few options.
We relaxed in the resort for the rest of the day, next morning we checked out, had a two hour cab drive worth Rs. 1350 ( both ways to and fro ellora), to Ellora, reached there around noon. Went about till 3 pm, and returned in the same cab all the way to Fardapur and then took the state transport bus to Jalgaon to catch my train. The mistake I made was, I shouldnt have returned to Jalgaon, should have gone to aurangabad from ELlora , and caught a train from there. It would have saved me a lot of fatigue!
Tips:
Try to go to the caves in the morning time. It saves you from heat, and also the crowd, as the day passes, there tend to be more people in the caves, from around aurangabad ( the locals), and that makes things a little irritating!
In ajanta, dont take a full guide for all caves, the more imp caves have care-takers who will tell you the basic stuff, and you can tip them accordingly. If you make use of them you will end up paying not more than Rs. 150/- for the entire set of Ajanta caves. ( Keep tenners handy to pay them).

Felt like a Boddhist Monk
Post by Saurabh
-Ellora caves are closed on mondays and Ajanta caves are closed on Tuesday, that makes it a truly weekend destination.
-Try to start early in the morning so that you get more time in the caves as closing time is about 6 PM.
-Stay at Aurangabad as Ajanta and Ellora are very well connected to the city, and in addition you can enjoy places in Aurangabad like Daulatabad Fort, Bibi ka Makbara (Mini Tajmahal), Paithan Garden, Panchakki etc.

Travelling Tips to Chandrapur



Chandrapur in one hour
Post by P | Mumbai | Jun 19, 2011
The auto fellows fleece the visitors as in every city but here they are a bit farfetched. A trip round the corner will cost rs50/-
There are no direct Bom-Chandrapur buses. Make sure you have a confirmed seat in the railways.

Travelling Tips to Elephanta Caves



Not a great trip!!
Post by Chintu | Mumbai | May 12, 2009
Please make sure you don't travel during the monsoons because the sea gets rough and the ferry services are discontinued till monsoon gets over..However some of the ferry operators ignore the rule and run the ferry which is very dangerous..
Don't fall for the old ladies who offer to get their pictures clicked..they start asking you for money once its done..
Look out for the locals who I feel are waiting for an opportunity to rip off visitors...
Dont mess with the monkeys...
If you are the nature types and wary enough you could have a good time with your friends family etc..

Visit to the World heritage Elephanta caves
Post by VRV | Mumbai | Aug 20, 2008
Catch a ferry early so you get good time to see and explore the beauty of the island.The last ferry on return is at 5:30 pm.There are no facilities for overnight stay-though there are a number of good restaurants for lunch / snacks.

So near.....but yet too far.
Post by Ankur | Mumbai | Dec 8, 2011
You can reach Church gate station and from there you can wither walk or take a taxi to Gate Way of India. From Gate Way of India there are ferries who take you to Elephanta caves.Its almost a 40 mins travel in the ferry. Once you get down from the ferry you need to walk from the Jetty and follow the road....It will tak you to the Caves. There is a small fee for the entry to the caves.

Travelling Tips to Sangli



To Visit Sangli Ganesh Temple
Post by Yogesh  | Pune | Jan 15, 2013
Car is a better option to reach Sangli. It is approximately 225 kms from Pune. The interior roads are quite good though lot of pot holes make your journey a little tiring.

Travelling Tips to Bordi



Beautiful beach
Post by Jayesh | Mumbai | Jan 1, 2012
When you search for MTDC Bordi in Google map, you will see two such place. Select MTDC resort and not MTDC tent for direction as the later is wrongly put on the map. Drive is pleasant with some bad patch and crowded Dhanu market. Enjoy driving on the Dahanu beach road.

You can either take the flying rani train from bombay central, borivali which reaches dahanu road within 1.5 hours or take a shuttle from Virar to Gholwad station (stn next to dahanu). The resort is just 3km from Gholwad. From Dahanu, the rickshaw charges upto rs 300 to reach bordi.

Bordi...be aware
Post by Rahul | Mumbai | Sep 15, 2008
Take gujarat express early in the morning and reach dahanu. Otherwise, you can take a Virar local and from Virar you get a passenger train every 1-2 hours. You can also get down at Gholvad station, check out the trains which stops there. You can take a rick from both places. We came back from Gholvad waking up early in morning and came by Valsad passenger at 6.00 am. We were at dadar by 9.

Travelling Tips to Ganapatipule



A Must Visit for Everybody
Post by Rajesh | Mumbai | Nov 8, 2006
We took an overnight train from CST (VT) Konkan Kanya Express which leaves at 11.00 pm and reaches ratnagiri at 6.35 pm. The timing of the train is conviniet since u reach ganpatipule before 9.oo am which would be ur check in time.From ratnagiri station u cand catch a ST BUS for ganapatipule or ask a couple of autos. they charge around RS 350 for one way trip, but it is worth it. While returning we booked ourselves on the Mandovi express which comes from Goa and reaches ratnagiri at 2.35 pm and reaches Mumbai at 9.00 pm. Trains r usually late though since the konkan railway runs only on a single track.

Serene, Calm, Enchanting and Enticing
Post by Rinaldo | Mumbai | Jun 30, 2009
Reaching Ganapatipule - The drive from Mumbai to Ganapatipule takes at least 8  9 hours covering a distance of 375 kms. It is well connected to Mumbai with Ratnagiri being the station closest to Ganapatipule.
Temperature- The day temperatures in the area range between mid 20 to 30 degree Celsius and is ideal to enjoy a dip in the waters. Nights though are cool and breezy. I must warn that the beach waters are highly salty and can easily lead to sun burn and skin pigmentation. I soon realised that the romance of the beach setting fades when you swim in its water.

Beach, beer and a 5km walk
Post by Shankar | Mumbai | Apr 26, 2008
Ganpatipule is an ideal weekend getaway from Mumbai and Pune. If you have a car, the journey (around 350 kms) should get done in 6-7 hours , marginally lesser for Puneites, marginally longer for Mumbaikars.
We did not have a car. We took the Janashatabdi from Mumbai, an ideal train to get there. It leaves Mumbai at the crack of dawn and touches Ratnagiri before 11 am. Ganapatipule is less than an hours ride by auto, so we were checking in by 12 noon. The autorickshaw guys charge a flat Rs 350.
For those on a budget, theres the bus option. You could take the excellent bus service from the rail station to Ratnagiri ST bus stand (7-8 kms), and find a bus from the ST stand to Ganaputipule. There is a bus almost every hour. The bus ride is a bit longer and lasts approximately 90-120 minutes. You could end up reaching Ratnagiri after 1 pm, which, if you ask me, is not the same as 12 noon.
A third option, if you can put up with night travel in a bus, is a direct ST bus from Mumbai or Pune. The ride is around 9-10 hours. A bus leaves Vashi at midnight, while there are buses from Borivli and Pune in the morning as well as the evening. You can check with the nearest MSRTC depot. The advantage of the ST is that you dont need to change buses to get there. The fare is also economical (Rs 175 one-way for standard STs) but I dont savour a night ride in a bumpy bus. I did when I was in college, but not any longer.
We stayed at the MTDC resort. The location is terrific as the resort hogs the beach. It spans half a kilometer of the prime beach front and is adjacent to the Shree Kshetra Ganapati temple, which lords over the rest of the beach. The gates of the resort and the temple face each other, the temple on the south and the resort on the north.
The resort is divided into two sections, upper and lower. Separating the two sections is a hillock which is part of the MTDC estate. The two sections run like independent hotels, with independent receptions, room services and restaurants. It is wise to select your rooms depending on which section you would like to stay.
The section closer to the temple, and therefore closer to the main gate, is the upper or higher section. This upper section has more rooms and has a larger and better-stocked restaurant. It is 30-75 feet above sea level, depending on the type of room you take. The price of the rooms goes up with the altitude. The rooms closest to the main gate are the cheapest, as they are non-AC rooms in one-storey buildings. The most expensive rooms in this section, the Sea View Cottage, are at the highest altitude (75 feet). In between them are the Super AC row houses. Each type of room has an independent flight of stairs heading down to the beach.
The second section is nearly a kilometre away from the main gate. The path to this lower section skirts the hillock that separates the two sections. If you take an auto from Ratnagiri and have chosen the lower section, ensure that you take the auto right in. The lower section is at sea level, so you dont need a flight of stairs to reach the beach. The independent rooms in this section are called Konkani huts. These huts are barely 50 metres away from the beach and the windows in the huts have a breathtaking view of the ocean. For budget travelers, this section has tents. I wouldnt recommend the tents.
The lower section also houses an unimpressive ayurveda centre and a rudimentary water sport facility (read paddleboats and motor scooters). The restaurant here is a satellite of the main restaurant in the upper section. It is open air and is very close to the beach, making it ideal location for beer (Rs 100 a chilled bottle). On the flip side, some of the dishes available in the upper section are not available here.
Upper or lower, where to stay: We stayed in a Konkani hut. When I visit Ganapatipule again, I would opt for the Super AC row houses in the upper section. These are roomier than the Konkani huts: they have a little parlour inside beside the bedroom and toilet. They also have a sheltered verandah outside. The view of the sea from the altitude is breathtaking; the wooden benches in front of the row houses are breezy cuddling spots.
The only problem with these row houses is that you need to climb down 30-40 steps to reach the beach. On the way up the stairs is a shower in an alcove where you can wash the sand away.
I really wouldnt climbing up and down, but I can understand why some guests would find that inconvenient. The lower section is at sea level and senior citizens would find it easier on the knees.
My problem with the Konkani huts is that they lack the shower, the parlour and the verandah. You come out of the beach and you are into the room. You drag sand in with you. If you are driving there, you can always drive down to the lower section for a beer or for a dip, if stairs are discomforting.
The best thing about Ganpatipule is the clean beach and the cleaner water. Early March is a great time to visit as the place is not too crowded and the weather is pleasant. I can imagine it getting warmer in April and May. The sea is not very rough, either; if anything, perhaps a bit too gentle. There are warnings all over the beach cautioning you not to venture deep. The beach lacks a lifeguard, so you are pretty much on your own.
We returned to Ratnagiri to take the Janashatabdi back. On hindsight, the choice of train was wrong as we chugged into Mumbai around midnight. The MTDC check out is at 9 am. It would be ideal to return by the Netravati which leaves Ratnagiri at 10 am and reaches Mumbai by 5 in the evening. You have time to unwind before heading for work the next day. Those who dont have the luxury of the extra day could consider a return bus journey (the only option for Puneites, really). The ST stand is just outside the MTDC resort. There are also a few private buses that leave in the evening.

Paradise of western coast
Post by Sushil | Lucknow | May 31, 2006
From mumbai one can go to Ratnagiri by train , which is over night journey. After that one can hire a taxi to reach Ganpatipule. Mumbai to ratnagiri is 375 km and from ratnagiri to Ganpatipule is 50 km. Dont go deep in the sea. there may be under current in the water.

Place to lay back and enjoy
Post by Rajani | Mumbai | Feb 28, 2011
If you are going from Mumbai, just take Dadar Sawantwadi express. Get down at Ratnagiri and take a bus 30kms. You reach MTDC resort. If at all you plan to visit any other places by car/bus, make sure to take good driver/good car as roads are curvey and bit dangerous too

Travelling Tips to Murud



Sun Sea and Sand
Post by Ashutosh
It is advisable to travel to this place in your own car. There is not much of a public transport system available here. This place is some 45 km further away from Ali Baug. From Pune, it is around 230 km. If you are travelling from pune then take the exit to khapoli and from here take the road to Pen. This is a short route but the road is in a bad condition. I will advise you to go to Panvel and take the Goa high away. You will save lot of time.

A peaceful weekend destination
Post by Wanderer | Pune | Mar 2, 2010
Dapoli (main town) is around 184 km from Pune. On Pune Banglore highway you have to take right at Bhor Phata which is just ahead of Khed Phivapur. The road takesyou straight to Mahad if you follow the sign boards. You have to cross NH-17 just outside Mahad and go straight to Dapoli through Latwan.
It will take almost 5 hours to reach since the road mainly goes through ghats. It's better not to start too early in the morning as it is difficult to drive through the ghats in the dark. You will reach by lunch time if you start at around 8 am.
Make sure your vehicle has enough fuel as there is hardly any fuel station once you leave the Pune-Banglore highway at least not before Dapoli. While coming back, try to leave by 4 pm is not before so that you can cross the ghat section before it's dark.
It's better not to visit Konkan during summer as the temperature and humidity both are on the rise. September to February should be ideal though post monsoon there are chances of land slide in some parts of the ghats.

Daploli vacation
Post by Nn | Pune | Jan 9, 2010
We went from Pune via Tamhini Ghat and returned via Mahabaleshwar. It takes about six hours to reach and eight hours to return through this route. Since our driver had advance information about Bhor Ghat being a bad route, we did not venture in it, although it is shorter.

Kashid beach
Post by Reality | Bangalore | Apr 28, 2006
Drive from Mumbai (5 + hours) or Pune. A less attractive alternative is to take the Catamaran from Mumbai to Alibag and then use local buses or autos to get to Kashid. Once the propsed bridge connecting Mumbai to the mainland goes up, the drive should not exceed 2 hours - so please pray for divine intervention on that one.

Travelling Tips to Alibaug



Enchanting 'ALIBAUG'
Post by Tarun | Bangalore | Apr 13, 2009
How to get there?
Alibaug is easy to get to in about an hour by the combination of a catamaran/ferry from Gateway of India in south Mumbai (three hours) and then by bus from Mandwa jetty across the bay.
It is also accessible by road via Panvel in about three hours (124 km).
By Boat/Cataraman/Ferry-
There are three agencies that run ferry services/catamarans: PNP, AJANTA and MALDAR. The ferry/catamaran takes you to Mandwa from Gateway by the sea route and from Mandwa, buses of the respective agencies takes you to Alibag by road. Catamarans are small ships. The tickets (costing 40 or 50 rupees) have to be bought beforehand and it includes the fare of the ferry service and the bus, both combined. Suppose you catch the ferry run by AJANTA, then remember after reaching Mandwa, you should not be in a mood to roam around because you have to immediately catch the connecting Bus of AJANTA from Mandwa to Alibag. Or else you will be left behind only to wait for the next bus. AJANTA and MALDARs ferry services helps to enjoy the sea breeze while PNPs catamaran service takes you in a fully covered AC coach and as a result you can by no way enjoy the sea. Dont forget to collect a timetable of the services of each agency at the ticket counter at Gateway. The last catamaran that leaves Gateway is by PNP at 8:10 PM. If you wish you can also have a view of the sea from the top of the ferry during your travel by the sea. The guys may charge you 10 bucks extra for going to the top of the ferry. The view of the Taj and the Gateway from the sea is awesome and dont forget to snap them, although Photography is prohibited on the Ferry as per notice by the Navy. The skyline of Mumbai is worth getting snapped. BUT its wise and better to ask the ferry personnel beforehand or else you may land up surrendering your film roll etc with embarrassment. Avoid planning ur travel during monsoons because this ferry service is stopped for three and a half months during the monsoons. The time taken to reach Alibag from Gateway via Mandwa is around 2 hours. The catamarans are faster than the ferry service so if you catch a catamaran you reach faster. Small passenger service boats ply frequently between Mumbai and Mandwa or Rewas. They are cheap but take more than 90 min
By Road-
There are a number of buses plying round the clock from Mumbai, Parel, Dadar, Boriwali and Thane. Alibag is on the Mumbai-Goa route (not exactly - from Vadkhal - there is a diversion) and is also accessible by Konkan Railway. Get down at Panvel and you can catch a bus.
By Rail-
Only two options - Get down at Panvel (65 Km) or Pen (Only Konkan Railway - Get down at Ramawadi Station - 23 Km). You can catch a bus. I will not recommend this option.
By Air-
Mumbai is the nearest airport. (Approx - 110 Km). Pune is another one.(140 Km). Getting off at Pune is not a good choice. You don't get frequent buses and journey is horrible.

WEEKEND GETAWAY
Post by Ashok | Nasik | May 31, 2011
Best way to reach Alibagh is by road with own vehicle. The vehicle is a must for the getaways to the various beaches. During summer vacation boarding in ac rooms is essential due to mosquitoes. Lodges are easily available. Boarding with locals at their cottages (approved by MTDC)should be tried any review on the same.

Alibaug-A truly mesmerizing experience.
Post by Kishore | Mumbai | Nov 11, 2010
Best way to reach Alibaug is by catamaran starting from Gateway of India. A short trip lasting for about 45 minutes is very relaxing and you do not realize how time flies while admiring the Mumbai coastline as you leave. In a short time Mandwa shore comes into view where you have to get down. You have to carry your own luggage along the jetty upto the bus (fare included in the catamaran charges) which is about 5-7 minutes walk. Hence it is advisable to travel light. Reaching Alibaug takes further 35-40 minutes bus ride.

Good overall experience - Alibaug
Post by Sumit | Pune | Apr 4, 2010
Approx. 3.5 hours from Pune. We preferred the old Mumbai-Pune highway. Having food at the Toni Da Dhaba was an added attraction. Non vegetarians would just love this Dhaba. The prices although are as much as that of a good restaurant. The feel of a Dhaba is very much there. For some time we felt we were in our very own Punjab.

Romantic Destination.
Post by Sneha | Mumbai | Aug 30, 2012
Alibaug is 40min ferry form Gateway where they drop you to Mandwa Jetty and from there the Ferry service has there to go go to city. The other option is roadways where it takes 3-4hours drive from Mumbai. Traveling by ferry is convenient and fun as well. But the ferry's don't work inn the rainy season so people have to cum by there own cars or the St service buses.

Travelling Tips to Kashid Beach





Small is Beautiful - Laid back beach town
Post by Shagun | Nagpur | Jan 19, 2011
The roads are very nice to get to Kashid from both sides. The sea would follow you on one side all the way. Its about 170kms from Pune and 135 from Mumbai.
As for the stay, there are a few hotels around, but the ideal thing to do is the Home-Stay experience. You can stay in proper mud houses with clay-tile roof and enjoy the feel.
Warning - Theres not much to do around the town or th beach, so make sure you carry some source of entertainment, like a book, ipod some sport gear.
The Mantra would be to just relax and lie back, after all its a Weekend to Chill.

Drive to Kashid
Post by Abhik | Pune | Nov 1, 2010
If you are driving from Mumbai:
Go to Panvel -> Palaspa Phata (take left) -> drive through Karnala -> Reach Khopoli -> Reach Pen -> Take diversion to Nagaon (before reaching Alibag) -> Take right from Revdanda
IF your goin from Pune:
Go to Lonavla -> Take khopoli exit (from expressway) -> Turn left at the 4 point crossing just after khandala (road towards Khopoli) -> Rest is same.
Else you could go via Paud road:
Road beside Up and Above restaurant -> Toll plaza -> Tamhini Ghat -> reach NH17 to Goa -> Go towards Mumbai on this highway for about 500 metres and take left to Kolad -> Reach Roha -> Reach Revdanda -> Go straight from Revdanda.

For a Fishy Rejuvenating Experience
Post by Ranee | Goa | Nov 15, 2007
Kashid is a beach town on the shores of Arabian Sea, in the North Konkan region of Maharashtra, India. It is located 30km from Alibag and 135km from Mumbai on the Alibag-Murud road.
The train connectivity is not very good but the arrival of the Konkan Railway has ensured that this area is now more accessible.
The road access is very good and the drive on the meandering konkan coast is pleasant
	160 km from Mumbai
	135 km from Thane
	110 km from Navi Mumbai (Vashi)
	170 km from Pune (via Mulshi)
Buses:
	Buses ply regularly between Mumbai Central - Murud -halt at Kashid
	Buses ply regularly between Thane  Murud- halt at Kashid
	Frequent services are available for Alibaug from Mumbai, Thane. From there buses are available for Murud which halt at Kashid village
Very secluded so go in a group. Cell phones do not work.

Kashid Beach
Post by Omkar | Pune | Nov 5, 2012
Kashid beach can be reached easily as it has easy access from the major cities of Maharashtra via the roadways. The guests can opt either of the route from the below mentioned route whichever is convenient for them to commute easily and safely.
 170 km from Pune via Mulshi, or
 The Khapoli  Pune Mumbai expressway, which is around 170-180 km from Pune
The better way to opt for commuting to the Kashid beach is using the Khapoli  Pune Mumbai expressway as it provides convenience with better road conditions as compared to the Mulshi route.
By Air: The nearest airport is Mumbai
By Rail: The closest railhead using the Konkan railway is via Roha railway station. Roha is 122 km from Kashid. You can even get down at Pen station using same railway line as pen is 60 km from Kashid.
By BUS: All buses that ply between Mumbai central - Murud halt at Kashid

BEST VACATION DESTINATION IN MAHARASHTRA
Post by Shruti | Mumbai | Sep 14, 2011
From Mumbai, Kashid is a 3 hr drive. The best part of Kashid is that it is very close to mumbai and a person does not need to spend a bomb and go to Goa to be on a clean beach. Pack some beach clothes, carry your sunscreen and enjoy a relaxing time at Kashid.

Travelling Tips to Dahanu



Serene place
Post by Prachi | Mumbai | Jul 30, 2012
Carry water /food during travel.The way from Mumbai does not have many eateries coz its highway throughout.Once you enter from the main highway into the rural patch,you cant find any food/water.Its just road.

The Cleanest Beach Destination
Post by Anand | Mumbai | Jan 28, 2013
There are various trains from Mumbai & Ahmedabad/Vadodara/Surat that halts at dahanu Station. Its just 2hrs from Mumbai, on the way to Gujarat. From Dahanu Station, you can take a private rickshaw for Rs.50 to Dahanu beach or shared auto for Rs.10 per person. You can carry some veg food if you are pure vegetarian or you can come back to Dahanu Station for restaurants. Carry your sun glasses & some woolen clothes as it was cold in Jan.

Travelling Tips to Gorai



Gorai - Mini Goa near Mumbai
Post by Great_traveller | Mumbai | Jan 10, 2012
1)By Public transport: Well connected to Mumbai suburb's Borivali station west with regular buses to Gorai Bus terminal.BEST Bus #294 takes you directly to Gorai jetty which otherwise is a short walk from Gorai bus depot.
2)By Own vehicle : The roadway route to Gorai exists....but its a long drive through diversion at NH8 via Bhayander-Uttan-Gorai..about 45 minutes.
TRAVEL WARNINGS: Swimming should be avoided at some of the unsafe beaches in the vicinity. Need to negotiate rates for carts and rickshaws beforehand on island unless you want to be taken on a joy-ride ;) !

Family Beach
Post by Nilesh | Mumbai | Dec 18, 2012
Keep Towels handy as the hotels may have damp ones. Travelling from borivali is an experience. Take a road route to Gorai Creek fom borivali / kandivali station, take the local ferry across and drive to beach in a rickshaw or tonga. if you are going for day trip be sure to return early in evening as ferry and buss services fro Bhayander station stop.

Less bad amongs the worst
Post by Abhijit | Mumbai | Dec 11, 2012
A lane going towards beach from uttan road is very narrow. if you are driving, be careful. Tank your vehicle sufficiently. Nearest fuel station is at least 20 Km away. Do swim but dont venture too much inside. Sea is deep here. and i haven't seen any life guards anywhere.

Travelling Tips to Port Blair



A place which reveals the extreme patriotism...
Post by Pamp | Chandigarh | Jun 6, 2011
Travel tips :
**Always Carry a Sun good Sunscreen lotion, Sun Glasses, some snacks and water with you.
**Carry some extra clothing while going to any beach.
How to reach :
From Kolkotta and Chennai both Ship and Flights are available. For Ship either you need to reach one of the ports a week before or contact to any trip maker for the relevant arrangement.
Travel Warnings :
If you are using a Reliance mobile connection then you need to switch it for some other one like Airtel, Vodaphone or BSNL,...as their is no Reliance coverage at all.

My experience at Port Blair
Post by Abhay | Indore | Nov 20, 2012
Flights operate from Chennai, Kolkata and Bhuvneshwar. Please plan you trip nicely and keep margin for bad weather otherwise you would miss a thing or two. In worst conditions, please do visit cellular jail and jolly buoy island.

Exotic Andamans
Post by Krishnan | Bangalore | Jan 20, 2011
Air travel is recommended as a time saver. A good lot of travel portals, offer good package deals, which are economic. Plan 2 to 3 months in advance to derive the benefit of low tariff. Carry only cotton stuff and informal and casual dress. Carry an umbrella and sun lotion with a spf factor of 60. Not advisable to go with chidren aged below 5, as they may not enjoy. To havelock, go by MV Markuzz. Pl go with empty or light stomached, as chances of vomitting are very high. Pl carry fresh lemon, poppins and anti vomitting tablets.

Amazing Andman
Post by Anand | Noida | Dec 23, 2012
Travellers flying into the Andaman & Nicobar Islands have to first arrive at Port Blair before taking a boat/ferry to any of the other islands. Frequent flights ply to Port Blair from Kolkata and Chennai.Taxis and auto rickshaws are available for the journey into the main city.

Andaman - Must Visit Destination
Post by Alok | Delhi | Dec 11, 2012
There is no direct flight from Delhi to Port Blair. I believe the shortest destination is via Calcutta. Secondly plan for your accommodation in advance else you need to pay little higher and there will not be any scope of negotiations. While in Port Blair City travel by auto not by taxi as any destination within city will not be more than 5 mins journey and taxi will charge Rs, 700-800 wherein by auto you can travel in maximum Rs. 30-40.

Travelling Tips to Havelock Island





THE PARADISE OF INDIA
Post by swastik73 | Kolkata | May 12, 2007
1) Fly to Port Blair from Kolkata or Chennai.
2) Reach Havelock either by Helicopter(should be booked well in advance) or Steamer.
3)The return Launch from Havelock comes in the evening (18:00 hrs - 18:30 hrs) so if you are coming by Sea you should make arrangement in Hotel at Port Blair well in advance (Check in time of Hotels at Port Blair 8:30-9:00 hrs).
4)If you afraid of water do not come to Havelock, you will get bored.
5) Although there had been no accidents but it is advisable not to travel to Havelock during Monsoon for people who are not brave enough in relation to water.
Travel Tips:
1) Carry Cash, because Credit Cards are rarely accepted.
2) Remember there is no ATM at Havelock Islands
3) Always carry a stick at night to protect yourself from stray dogs.
4) Do not venture out in the Forest at night - Snakes
5) Listen to the locals and pay heed to their advice.
6) Have plenty of Liquor of your Choice. Liquior is very cheap
7) You can hire a cycle, travel by auto or bus or even hire a car as per your pocket and convienence.
8) If you are hiring Motor Bike/ Moped please check the condition of the Bike. If you donot check it, it may develop trouble and you may be required to pay substantial amount to repair it. It is better to Walk or hire a cycle then to hire a bike with both physical and machine trouble.
9)

Emerald Isles
Post by Susmita | Mumbai | Aug 28, 2012
Closest Airport - Port Blair, India.
Avoid the Rainy season while planning your visit.
Boats come to Havelock from Port Blair each morning and return every afternoon.
Spending a few days on the island allows you to soak in the atmosphere. Carry a good supply of mosquito repellent and Sun block (not sun screen) if you do not want a severe tan or sun burns.
Cotton clothes, floaters, swimming and diving gear are essentials.
Let the hotel people arrange your taxi and boat - share the same with others to split the cost or don't if you want the vehicles at your beck and call.
The boat men run many trips after dropping you to a destination so be firm in your arrangements and agreement. People are simple and helpful and politeness goes a long way.

Enchanting Havelock
Post by Kalyan | Pune | Apr 3, 2012
Once you reach the island via catamaran Makruzz (fare IR700 one way) or Govt. Boat (fare slightly less) it is advisable to hire services of a travel vehicle. Autos are available but are a pain to deal with; otherwise hire a two wheeler on a daily basis ( fuel to be bought from roadside shops - high price) or a bicycle if you can manage to rough it out. There are no street lights - and roads are not too wide. Hence it is better to walk to the jetty or the small bazaar after sunset.

The Emerald Islands of the Andamaans
Post by Neeraj | Delhi | Feb 17, 2011
Flights usually reach Port Blair in the morning. If you are lucky, you can catch the McCruze, a privately owned ship which reaches you to Havelock in 90 minutes. Its expensive though at Rs. 650, 750, and 1000. The government ferry is much cheaper at Rs. 200 but takes 2 and 1/2 hours and runs only in the afternoons. There is also a sea plane now, at Rs. 2000 per person, seats only 9 people allowing only 5kg. baggage but affords an areal view of the islands and takes only 20 minutes.
Go armed with a good sunscreen cream, hats and sunglasses, and mosquito repellents.

Travelling Tips to Neil Island



Paradise on earth
Post by Tony martin | Chennai | Jun 24, 2012
Take the Govt Ferry from Port Blair. You might get to see Dolphins if you are lucky.
You can also arrange for private boats from havelock, i think. Barefoot provides day tour to Neil including snorkeling for around 1000per person i think.

Travelling Tips to Chatham Island





Chatam Saw Mill
Post by Prabhakar | Mumbai | Dec 28, 2010
Very simple way to reach. Most of the local buses terminate at Chatam Saw mill. All these buses move around the Portblair town, so one can get into the bus from any where. The place is close to one of the Jetty and hence, have a great view of Large ships at a close distance.

Travelling Tips to Nagarjunasagar





Perfect weekend destination
Post by Tanveer | Hyderabad | Feb 28, 2012
I covered the sight-seeing places in this way:
Started from hyderabad at around 5AM
Reached a small town on the way around 7:30AM had a good local breakfast
Reached Sagar around 8:30AM, and to the boat house in another 10 mins.
The first boat starts at 9:30AM so I had time to drive to Anapu which is 8KM from the boat house, this place has some Buddhist excavations preserved here, and the garden and scenery around hills and dam waters is very good for eyes.
Reached back to boat house by 9:20AM, there was not much crowd so they issued the tickets a little late and the boat started by 10AM
Reached Nagarjuna Konda and back at 1PM.
Drove back to Vijay Vihar (this resort is ~15KM from boat house)
Had the lunch there and checked-in to the room I had booked (booking online from APTDC site)
Started to Ettipotala falls around 4PM - This falls is ~20KM from resort.
I reached the falls around 5PM, nothing much to see here except the falls and this falls is lighted up with lights after dark, I enjoyed seeing the falls at night in the colored lights.
Reached back to Vijay Vihar at night, Dinner at a restaurant that is 1KM from Vijay Vihar
Next day morning took the steps down from the back of the resort that leads upto the dam waters.
This was a very lovely site to see the waters and the area around. The scenery was really awesome.
Checked out around noon and reached Hyderabad in evening.

Break from Hyderabad-Nagarjunasagar Dam
Post by Arti mukesh | Bangalore | Mar 27, 2008
.We both are happy to be staying busy, but we both needed a break from our schedule.
My husband needed a time off from his travel for work, with no Internet access. No cooking for me, easy laundry options and time together itself was welcome. It was a much-needed breather from the normal routine .
All things come to an end and so did our lazy, carefree weekend. It is said and I strongly believe that taking time off and to just not think anything allows one to think 200000000000000 times faster. But .Too much thinking can be just as bad as not enough, after allENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!

Good for a good weekend
Post by GV | Secunderabad | Jan 30, 2009
Lots of buses to Nagarjuna Sagar from Imliban and JBS from Hyderabad. Start at about 7 am to reach by 11 am with one stop for tea. Lots of towns and villages enroute so dont speed. Dont venture into waters because its infested with crocodiles. If travelling with families then Haritha Resorts is the best bet. It has a good view of the river and the rooms are spacious with swimming pool and play material for kids. The rates at Nagarjuna Resort on the other side of the Dam and Haritha Resorts or APTDC is same. Dont plan overnite stay at Ethipothala because its too remote a place with no crowd at all. Not worth it. Carry cool clothes because it gets hotter as day progresses. Carry mosquito repellents.

We had a nice weekend break but it may not be a fun holiday so plan accordingly. All you lovers of temple architecture in HyderabadWarangal is a place worth a visit onceits very safe towards the end the thought of naxalites was so diluted that we just didnt remember that there was a fear lurking over us at the beginning of our holiday(I know there are too many temples). But enjoy the break!!!!!!

Travelling Tips to Rajahmundry



the beautiful Godavari
Post by Sampath kumar | Bangalore | Jan 2, 2011
The Rajahmundry town is easily reachable by bus or train from Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam or Vijayawada and so on. The railway line is well situated on the main and busy Chennai- Kolkata(Howrah) line with many fast trains passing throuhg it. By road also it is situated on the famous 6 lane NH 5 highway. The cabs are available at reasonable rates to make visits to the surrounding famous shrines/places.

A city on the banks of River Godavari
Post by Sarma
Rajahmundry is well connected to Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad,Delhi and Kolkata with direct express trains. One can travel to the city by direct flight from Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. Cabs can be used for local travel. Avoid the period July- September as that is the rainy season.

Due to the Godavari River the place is worth visiting.
Post by Narendra  | Indore | Mar 5, 2013
Do not venture to Rajahmundry specially in Summers. It is very hot there. Can travel by train or busess. Southern Railway going to Vijayawada & Kakinada touches Rajahmundry.

Rajahmundry and Papikondalu
Post by M.raja
If provided sufficient time and travelling on own vehicle, don't miss Maredumilli and Rampa water falls on the way to Badrachalam. Great place for nature lovers. Thick forest and water falls. Don't miss bongu-chicken.

Best way to travel from Bangalore to Anantapur
The distance between Bangalore and Anantapur, is around 220 km. It takes a little more than four and half hours of driving, from Bangalore to Anantapur. One can just follow NH7, crossing Devanahali, Chikballapur, Beggapalli, Budili, Penulonda and Nyamaddala. It is advised to have a stopover at Beggepalli for a tea break and fuel refills; because, after that, for 117 km, there is no decent place to stop. Though the road condition is generally good, except for when it rains, it is better to avoid driving at night. 

Transport options from Bangalore to Anantapur
Bangalore to Anantapur By Bus: Take a bus from Bangalore to Anantapur, which takes around four and a half hours. Anantapur Bus Terminal is located at a distance of around 11 km from the city centre and can be reached by taking a bus or an auto-rickshaw. Travelling by bus is economical and ideal for individual travellers and backpackers. 

Travelling Tips to Anantapur



Ooty - Coonoor- Pykara
Post by Sham | Bangalore | Nov 10, 2012
I would advise to go in colder seasons as it is non-seasonal time for the city and the expenses will be less too. Take a Volvo bus or a train. You will just enjoy it as it is getting darker, the fog covers the entire city and it is fascinating to watch that site.

Travelling Tips to Lepakshi



Lepakshi, the archaeological marvel of southern India
Post by Ankur | Bangalore | Jun 11, 2012
We reached there in our car becasue we live in Bangalore and its quite near from Bangalore. However, bus and auto rickshaw service is available on NH7 and Lepakshi road junction.

One day trip to Lepakshi
Post by magicpotion | Bangalore | May 15, 2009
The roads are good through most of the journey. There is this left turn opposite a Mosque and a checkpost (No proper checkpost sign) to go towards Lepakshi. Need to be careful as to not miss this turn, better to ask a couple of locals after Bagepalli village for guidance. It gets very hot during summers and may be difficult to walk barefoot around the temple. You may wear socks to protect your feet and carry hats/sunglasses too. However, you need to remove the hat,socks etc inside the temple where pooja is performed.

Travelling Tips to Badami





Golgumbaz - the tomb of your innermost Voices of Soul

Badami, Aihole, and Pattadakkal
Post by Amit | Bangalore | May 3, 2006
All three destinations are quite far from each other. The destinations are accessible by medicore roads from Belgaum, Hubli, Hospet and Goa. The closest train station would be at Hubli.
Avoid travelling here in the summer due to extreme heat. Best time to travel would be the winter months. Clubbing Hampi with a visit to these destinations is strongly recommended.

Tour to Badami
Post by srini | Mumbai | Feb 20, 2011
If you are looking for road transport, Ilkal and Gadag are two favourite places connected to Badami. Ilkal is about 2h 15m drive from Badami and connected to most of the places.
While visiting Badami caves, beware of monkeys. They snatch away water bottles and any bags suspected to contain eatables. They are very very smart.

Travelling Tips to Hampi



The Kishkindha kingdom of Mahabharata
Post by Priyanka | Bangalore | Jul 16, 2011
I travelled from Bangalore and took a KSRTC bus, reached in about 6-7 hours. The bus stop is around 10 kms before Hampi. From there you have frequent sharing-autos and individual autos too. Or there is a bus that goes to and fro every half an hour.

Peace!!
Post by Savio | Bangalore | Feb 9, 2011
If you are travelling from Bangalore, please be warned that the road till Chitradurga is brilliant. But after that, be prepared for what I would call, the worst experience of my life. Unfortunately for me, when I booked my bus tickets, only the last sleeper was available. In the middle of the night, it felt like I was suffering from an everlasting seizure. This carried on till I got to Hospet. Got down from the bus feeling all mixed up. On my way back, the bus driver told me that the government will be repairing this road soon. Considering its on the way to a World Heritage Site, it should have been done a long time back. But I wouldnt want to comment on that aspect. So please try and avoid this road.
In Hampi, if you want to get to the other side of the Tungabhadra, please be informed that this place is accessible by a small boat which runs every 5-10 minutes and the last trip is at 6 P.M. Each trip costs you Rs.15. The only other way is you need to go to Hospet and from there its around 30kms which means youll be travelling close to 45kms. Take the boat. It just takes 2 minutes.
Apart from this, there is nothing else you need to be worried about. People here are friendly and you can get around pretty easily.

Heritage at every footstep...
Post by wanderlust | Bangalore | Jan 8, 2010
From Bangalore there are various buses plying towards Hampi. Even if you don't get a direct bus,you can take any bus going to Hospet or Chitradurga and then change over to a bus for Hampi.

Visit to Vijaynagar ruins...Hampi
Post by Sudarshan | Bangalore | Jun 7, 2009
The best way to travel from Bangalore is by train. It is the most safe, cheap and relaxed way to travel. There is a train 'Hampi Express' that's available every night 10:30 PM and reached the Hospet by morning 8 am. Hire an auto, negotiate and you should get a price of Rs 100 or less to get u to Hampi, 15 kms from here.

The Forgotten Dynasty: Wonderfully historic, Real.
Post by Sanila | Bangalore | Mar 5, 2009
From Bangalore, Hampi can be reached by bus or train. All trains and most buses go till Hospet. You need to take another local bus or an auto to get to Hampi. The train ride is said to be longer than necessary, so if you're strapped for time, take a bus. Do make your bookings (both journeys) in advance.
Accommodation is plenty. I suggest not to make reservations ahead. The norm is to get there and check out 2 or 3 places and take a call.
Hampi has frequent power cuts, so make sure your phones and camera batteries are well charged.
Wear lose light cotton clothes and good comfortable footwear. You will be walking about quite a bit.
Be careful of touts.. these include guides,auto drivers and middle men working for guest houses. Avoid carrying valuables on this trip. Drink plenty of water to avoid getting run down by the heat.You must carry good sun screen , a hat and shades.
There are lots of monkeys at the ruins. They are not friendly!

Travelling Tips to Mysore





Cultural Bliss
Post by Savio | Bangalore | Mar 31, 2011
From Bangalore, take the Mysore Highway. I is just a 150 KM drive and the road is in an excellent condition. You will really enjoy the drive. For people relying on public transport, you can take a Volvo from Bangalore. Every half an hour a Volvo departs from Bangalore to Mysore. Then there is also a train which goes to Mysore from Bangalore,

Mysore - The Hub for the Variety Seeking Traveller
Post by Surej | Bangalore | May 30, 2006
Train from Bangalore not recommended unless you use the upmarket ones. Bus is comfortable or Car as gives you more mobility. Avoidable during the Holiday season and Dussera as it gets crowded . You can get very good bargains upto 30 percent off on Rooms in the Resorts around during the weekdays which have pools etc.

A short leap to Mysore & Srirangapattna
Post by Abhilekh | Hyderabad | Dec 2, 2011
For Mysore buses & trains are easily available from all over Karnataka, Nearest Airport is bangalore & mangalore.
For affordable & quick trip opt flight to Mangalore as Bangalore has hell lot of traffic prob & cab will not cost u much in mangalore as comparing to bangalore.
Select hotels which are within 1-2 km frm mysore palace as it saves time & money & city bus stand is near so by paying 15rs u can get city guide to follow buses routes & the bus service is really best.

Travelling Tips to Srirangapatna



History Re-visited
Post by Hina | Bangalore | May 31, 2006
A little further down the Gumbaz takes you to the banks of the main Cauvery. Dip your feet into the water, or take a Coracle boat ride across the river.
A listing of the key attractions along with a route map is prominently displayed at all the sites. This is primarily a place for leisurely site seeing - people wanting a lot of action should stay away!
Srirangapatna is located about 15 kilometers north east of Mysore

A small historically important town
Post by Saty | Bangalore | Jan 1, 2012
Plenty of buses from Mysore, most Mysore bound KSRTC non-stops from Bangalore entertain a request stop at Srirangapatna, a very few trains stop at the Srirangapatna rail station. Autos are available in the rail station to take you around, but bargain beforehand.

Travelling Tips to Sakleshpur



Lesser Known Attractions of Sakleshpur
Post by SS | Bangalore | Nov 21, 2009
There are trains to Sakleshpur from Bangalore and Mangalore 3 days a week. It is also only a 4 hour drive from Bangalore. So, get out on a weekend and enjoy the hills, greenery, waterfalls and the fresh air.

For all seasons - Sakleshpur
Post by Soups | Bangalore | Mar 20, 2010
Best to use your own vehicle. Just about a four hour drive from Bangalore and possibly 2-3 hours from Mangalore. Day train is available from Bangalore and lots of buses but you'll be strapped for transport unless you're planning to be at a homestay that provides you with a vehicle to move around. The monsoon is pretty strong in this region and although it is the most beautiful time, it can also be daunting for those who dislike wet weather.

Unexplored Gems of Sakleshpur
Post by SS | Bangalore | Nov 28, 2009
By road from Bangalore. Start early morning from Bangalore, you will reach Sakaleshpur by 11 am. There is a day train from Bangalore too. However getting around Sakaleshpur may be a challenge.

Good experience overall
Post by Ratham
This is specially for the people driving from Bangalore. The road is beautiful and irresistible to drive fast. However better to keep a check on speed. People drive really really fast, one's foolishness should not end up in another man's misery.

one of the best place in sakleshpur to stay
Post by Priyanka | Bangalore | Feb 9, 2013
Its very near to bangalore so best destination if you are planning for 2-3 days trip. it takes exactly 4 hrs from bangalore to reach sakleshpur. the road is really great so problems at all. its better to start at around 7 am from bangalore so around 11-12 noon , you will be there and can enjoy great food in the swastha. On the way there are not many good restaurants except coffee day so its better you keep some food stuff for you.

Travelling Tips to Idukki



Even a month is not enough to fully enjoy natures marvel - Idukki district
Post by Florien | Mumbai | Jun 6, 2008
Hire a private taxi with driver for the entire trip, it is worth it as you will always have transport when you require. Convenient airports are Nedumbassery at Cochin, Coimbatore and Madurai. Angamaly or Aluva nearest rail heads from the Cochin side. Very safe area so just the usual precautions required. Everyone in Kerala is aware of the benefits of tourism so they are all very courteous and friendly to visitors.

A little closer to heaven
Post by Jitin | Cochin | Apr 14, 2011
I travel mostly by car or bus. Any bus will do as long as it goes to your destination. Transfers aren't the easiest things and you can get lost if you aren't familiar with the place or have a language barrier.

Vagamon - the number you are trying to reach is not reachable...
Post by Siraj | Bangalore | Jan 12, 2007
Vaagamon is in Kerala... So get to Cochin by flight, bus or train and hire a cab to take you to Vaagamon via kottayam.
In case you are driving yourself, the best vehicle to take you there is a Scorpio, Tavera or one of the 4X4s... I went in with my Baleno (a car well known for low ground clearance) and actually did not face too much of troubles...

The best way to reach Munnar is to get to Cochin and then take the bus or hire a vehicle to reach Munnar in 3-4 hours. For local travel in Munnar request your hotel to organize a vehicle. There are star category hotels and resorts catering to the needs of tourists. Warm fleece jacket or woolen jumpers are necessary. Take an umbrella or raincoats because heavy clouds might appear quite suddenly over the mountains. After 5pm thick fog starts to envelope the hills sometimes giving zero visibility. Plastics are banned in Munnar panchayat. Avoid the monsoon season while visiting Munnar.

An Encounter with Pristine Nature
Post by Dipankar | Ranchi | May 26, 2011
Nearest Airport as well as Rail head is Kochi about 130 km away. Buses are available from Kochi, but hiring a cab helps in coming to close contact with nature, there are a number of unknown sightseeing points on the way to Munnar, none of them will be missed !
So what are you waiting for ? Pack your baggage and you are out for an encounter with pristine nature, you will never forget !!!

Fabulous Munnar
Post by Deepak | Bangalore | May 7, 2011
Nearest Airport and Railway station to reach Munnar is at Kochi, which is 138km away. The drive from Kochi to Munnar takes around 3.5 to 4 hours. The worst part of the journey is within Kochi, wherein you experience traffic jams.
The route to Munnar is scenic with abundant scenery. But the roads are full of sharp curves and you would be advised to eat lightly before travelling.

MUNNAR carpeted with tea gardens
Post by Rehana | Mumbai | Apr 30, 2012
The nearest airport and railway station to Munnar are at Kochi, which is 130 km away. Many buses and taxis ply to Munnar from Kochi, Coimbatore and Madurai. Nearest railway station to Munnar is Aluva which is 120 Kilometers away and Ernakulam Town and Ernakulam Junction which are 130 kms ...
But the ride is with lots of twists and turns so do take care of your medications.

A pleasant vacation
Post by VRV | Mumbai | May 10, 2011
Munnar is about 130 kms from Kochi railhead and the airport. Private taxis, and state buses can take you there in about four to five hours.
If one has own arranges car, then best is to stay a little away from the town to get the real feel of Munnar.

Travelling Tips to Wayanad





Adventurous Trip - from 14-04-2011 to 16-04-2011
Post by Sandhya | Mysore | Apr 23, 2011
Mysore --->55 Kms Gundulpet -----> 55 Kms Sulthan Bathery ----> 25 Kms Kalpetta - the district headquarters of Wayanad.
Kalpetta is a junction place for all sight seeing places.
We can get plenty of beautiful resorts and Home-stay in and around Kalpetta.
Roads are too good, well maintained for driving.

Wayanad
Post by Kanchan | Bangalore | Jan 4, 2007
From Bangalore its a 6 hr drive through Mysore, Gundlupet, Sulthan Bathery and Kalpetta. Vythri has a lot of jungle resorts. One can choose to stay in a jungle resort in Vythri or in Kalpetta. We stayed in a jungle resort which was great, but the approach road is through a jungle and only a Mahindra jeep can do it. There is another route which is baiscally going through Srirangapatna, Hunsur, Nagarhole, Tholpetty and reaching Kalpetta. THe drive is very beautiful as there is a 70 KM drive through the jungle, but about 18 kms of the road is bad.

My Wayanad experience
Post by Sreejith
Do not travel with family in night in forest area. its dangerous if you find a wild elephant in roadsides. maybe they attack you and your vehicle. if you find any elephant on the way please stop your vehicle. do not switch off your vehicle headlight. if they come near you dont make any noise. wait till they moved to other places. Mananthavady to Kutta route and Muthanga to Gundalpettu route is most dangerous in night drive. avoid these route in night. access to Wayanad:Calicut to Kalpetta 75 kms Madikeri ( Coorg ) to Mananthavady 120 kms. Mysore to Sulthan Bathery 120 kms. Ooty to Kalpetta 117 kms. Most important town in Wayanad district with accommodation options Mananthavady, Sulthan Bathery Kalpetta and Vythri. From Kalpetta easy access to most of all important tourist places in Wayanad.

Travelling Tips to Nelliyampathy



Nelliyampathy and coffee blooms...
Post by Saji | Cochin | Apr 22, 2009
Route:Palakkad-Nenmara-Pothundi Dam-Kaikatti(at the top) -Pulayanpara
There are buses from Palakkad and if you have a vehicle you can reach Pulayanparra and unless if you are a four wheel drive,sturdy SUV owner you will have to avail the jeeps for visiting all the exotic places.
The jeep guys will take you for a night safari also at higher rates,but beware there might be an angry tusker on the prowl who is ever ready to overturn your jeep and practice stampeding.

awesome place to visit
Post by Senthil ramkumar | Salem | Nov 9, 2010
route No1: Coimbatore- Palakkad- Kudavayoo-kolangode
nice drive but slightly longer than the other(via Pollachi) u have to drive almost 100+ kms inside Kerala state. road from Kollangode to Nemarra is slightly irritating with lot of pot holes. roads in nemmara town isnt good either. ghat section from nemara to neliyampathy is awesomesingle sided indeed as u go further up u get to look at the view of poonthondi dam. many small water falls r seen on the way to. Roads aren't winding nor hectic.

Visit to Nelliampathy
Post by Monica | Chennai | Mar 1, 2013
To reach nelliampathy, the best choice is to take our own car such that we can travel to every place possible at nelliampathy. Bus timings are frequent. If not, you can enjoy the ksrtc bus rides that go like roller coaster on the hills roads.

Vagamon - Feel near god
Post by Prakash kumar | Chennai | Sep 4, 2012
Take train to KOTTAYAM in Kerala. & you can hire a cab to reach Vagoman
(65km aprox).The roads are average.
There are no good hotels in Vagoman city. so carry your food from the resort
itself to avoid any disappointments

Travelling Tips to Kalpetta



The mountain country
Post by Bijoy | Bangalore | Dec 3, 2011
Accessible by road from Calicut or Mysore from the western side. It's a 3 hr drive from Mysore through the Bandipur Santuary.
Avoid night travel on the highway because of winding roads that are scarry in the dark with the thick vegetation cutting your sight short.

KALPETTA - unforgettable experience.
Post by Vv | Hyderabad | May 23, 2010
From BANGALORE to KALPETTA.
Early start is better 6.30 TO 7.00AM ( to avoid traffic of bangalore)
after 40 kms you will find restarant KADUMANE .
You can have break fast here . and you can proceed to Mysore. ( BAN-MYSORE 145 KM )
BY 11.00 AM You can go around Mysore have a look at CHAMUNDI BETTA, KRS DAM .
You can have lunch in an of the hotels on palace road. You cannot find hotels that easily in Mysore. As most of the hotels are on palace road.
You can leave Mysore by 2pm, it takes 3 hours to reach WAYANAD ; 145 KMS.
Always keep mineral water bottles/ fruits/ juices with you ( 3 to 4 minimum ) Once you leave mysore, you don't get anything to eat before wayanad.
from Mysore
You will NANJANGUD
then GUNDLUPET from here you have to take a right . ( ROAD shows towards KOZHIKODE( CALICUT) from Gundlupet - KALPET AROUNG 80 KMS
You can see BANDIPURA FOREST
MUTHANGA WLID LIFE SANCTUARY
then town of SULTAN BATTERY
before reaching KALPETTA.
Always drive in day time only to KALPETTA.
have a nice stay in kalpetta.

Visit to WAYANAD's heavenly abode at Kalpetta
Post by Samir
One can enter from Bangalore - Mysore national Highway . Bangalore to Mysore road distance is 120 km. From Mysore 60 ams drive will take you to Gundalpet. Another 55km drive will take one to Sultan Bathery. Further drive for 24 km will bring one to Kalpetta. If one visits from Kozhikode (calicut) side, then 64 km drive will bring him to Chundale via Vythiri and then to Kalpetta. It can also be accessed from Coimbatore- ooty, Gudalur, Sultan Bathery side . If one travels from Mysore side then he should cross the stretch of NH 212 in the forest to enter Kerala before dusk so as not to disturb the movement of animals accross the road. One should not park vehicle after 5pm on NH212 from Mysore to Muthanga(Kerala).

Post by Gopalakrishnan | Chennai | Dec 23, 2012
Cabs fare also very nominal, when compare to other tourist places. From chennai, direct train is available to karaikal.
Though, beach is there and not many people are there... There is no transport from town to Beach, except Auto Not advisable to stay in beach for outsiders, after 7.30 pm.

Travelling Tips to Kanyakumari



Where the seas and the ocean meet
Post by George
If your base is Thiruvananthapuram or Nagercoil, Kanyakumari can be covered in a day. Else (or if you want to spend more time here), there are plenty of hotels in all budget ranges to spend a night or two.
Kanyakumari is well connected both by buses and trains. The nearest airport is 87 kms away at Thiruvananthapuram.

A MEMORABLE VISIT TO KANYAKUMARI
Post by Subrato | Bangalore | Oct 30, 2010
I suggest that you head direct to Kanyakumari, take a breather there for a few days and then visit to nearby places like Rameshwaram, Madurai, Thiruvanantapuram or even Kodaikanal. It can be arranged easily from the hotel itself or through travel agencies in abundunce at Kanyakumari.

The Calm but crowded Cape Comorin!
Post by Sunitha | Kanpur | May 26, 2011
BY Road, straight onto National highway 47 from Trivandrum, passing through Parrashala, Marthandam and Nagercoil. its a smooth drive even at night. The only tricky regio as about 5 km away from Kanyakumari, there is a crossing of NH47 and NH7. Picking up your route after the swirl is a challenge.

Unforgettable experience.
Post by Kishore | Delhi | Nov 21, 2012
We have gone to Madurai by air from Delhi. From there, we took a cab for going to Rameshwaram and thereafter to Kanya Kumari. The journey from Rameshwaram to Kanyakumari was very beautiful with scenic views. You should be careful while traveling with small children.

Nice Sea shore holiday destination mixed with history education to kids
Post by Akula | Hyderabad | Feb 6, 2011
You could reach here with a 40 to 60 minute cab drive from Chennai Railway station / Airport. Sun cream, sun glasses and a well covering hat are a must. Mentally prepared for a long walk to have the best experience!

Mahabalipuram - Hot, Sweaty but Sublime Carvings on the Sea Shore
Post by Sudeep | Bangalore | Oct 25, 2010
We drove down from Bangalore. Good Road. Down the NH7 to Krishnagiri, turn left onto NH47 and then to Sriperumbudur. Turn right onto a very good Tambaram Bye-pass (Toll road) and come out at Vendulur Zoo. Turn left there and keep going till the end of the road which is the ECR, where one turns right and goes straight till Mahabs.

Travelling Tips to Thanjavur



The Big Temple.
Post by Feline | Bangalore | Jan 18, 2011
Since it is in the heart of the city, a rickshaw ride should cost you Rs 40/50. If you are travelling in your private vehicle, no problem. After temple, again you will have to travel 2 km to see the Palace, Sarswati Library (which has old maps and palm leaves - naadi shastra was written) and a museum which has beautiful bronze and other material sculptures. Some entrance fees are charged at the entrance of the palace but no entrance fees to see the temple.

Temple tour
Post by Vinod | Chennai | Apr 10, 2013
By road from Chennai via Pondy it is a great experience. Thanjavur being the rice bowl of TN, you can see a lot of paddy fields. It is five hours from Pondicherry by car and one can stop at Kumbakonam, the land of a 1000 temples, en route. There is a small stretch on the grand anicut dam which is narrow and traffic gets delayed.

Trichy - looking ahead
Post by S. anandan | Chennai | Nov 24, 2011
Some tips that i follow:
-dress very casually, usually in cotton clothing's.
-do not hassle with the 'auto' drivers, most of the time they are very polite.
-do not over eat or eat a lot of spicy foods through out the day.
-if you can speak Tamil, it is definitely an extra advantage, even tough English is perfectly alright.

Travelling Tips to Tuticorin





THE SALT TOWN
Post by mssthirdeye | Bangalore | Mar 21, 2013
CAN BE REACHED BY AIR (airport 16kms) but do arrange for pick up beforehand,
Tuticorin is on the seaside and hence will be really hot anytime of the year.

Travelling Tips to Hosur



Anchetti
Post by Nagabhushan | Bangalore | Oct 7, 2008
We rode on for a couple of kilometers more before abandoning our plans to look for a tea shack. Sat down by a compost heap and took a few sepia-toned photographs with the mobile. Started back and halted midway on the climb, though we had read caution notices that passengers should not alight at these places. We reasoned that it made more sense during nights, especially when the vegetation was lush and water was plenty, which draw out the elephants from their daytime retreat.
Then we heard the sound of water flowing, spotted the muddy brown stream gushing amongst boulders way below, noticed there were some young fellas who had probably been swimming somewhere nearby. It was a typically non-threatening stretch of forest with the winding road acting like a lifeline! Only when you spend enough time off the road do you appreciate the existence of a road however humble!!
Then we continued up to the outskirts of Denkanikota, stopped for some grub as we felt ravenously hungry, proceeded to Sudhir's ancestral home which I was visiting after many, many years. There was absolutely no disrepair as I feared - in fact, it had been improved in patches and was absolutely comfortable as we stepped in from the sun. We gobbled up some jackfruit that grew in the backyard, chit-chatted some more and hit the road again.
This time we managed to take the road towards TVS Motors and then linked up to NH4. Our journey home was halted briefly as the rain lashed out, and, more hot food awaited us when we reached home. We did not ask for anything else!! The romance with Anchetti had concluded, promising to resurface on some unsuspecting rainy day!
One thing however had changed: Anchetti was no longer just a name, a destination or a possibility - it had entered the long list of places that have suffered a visit by us!! Long live Anchetti!

Travelling Tips to Tawang



Exotic Arunachal
Post by Santanu
We were aided in our tour plan by sites like www.indiamike.com, www.holidayiq.com, tawang.nic.in, arunachalpradesh.nic.in and Himalayan holidays etc. Furthermore, the District Tourism Officer at Bomdilla Mr. Riggio also helped us plan our conveyance. We contacted the Managing Director of Himalayan Holidays Mr. Tsering Wange who also helped us plan the tour and he provided us with the conveyance, a Tata Victa driven by Mr. Samar Das an young, confident and safe driver.
The Tourist Lodge at Bomdilla (Rooms ranging from Rs. 400  Rs. 600) cannot be booked from before, but generally rooms are available. In case it is booked there is yet another Guest House, the Doe-Gu-Khil Guest House near Gaden Rabgye Ling Monastery better known as the upper Gompa, which is very good though a bit costlier Tourist Lodge at Tawang. There are also Tourist Lodges at Dirang and Bhalukpong).
Besides, we also contacted other authorized tour operators Mr. Abhijeet and Mr. Trideep.

Fairy Land of Northeast
Post by Saroj madhusudan | Delhi | Jul 24, 2011
We started early (6:30 AM) from Guwahati on 18th March 2011. Had lunch at Bhalukpong (12:30 PM) and reached Bomdilla at 04:30 PM. Night halt was at Bomdilla ( Govt. Tourist Rest House).Started next day (06:30 AM on 19th March) to Tawang. Had breakfast enroute at Dirang (2 hrs drive). Site seeing on the way ... Nyukmadung War Memorial, Sela Pass, Jaswantgarh War Memorial, Madhuri Falls. Had snacks at Jaswantgarh military canteen. Reached Tawang at 05:00 PM. Night halt at Govt. Tourist Lodge in Tawang. On 20th March local site seeing. started back to Bomdilla on 21st March (visited monastries at Dirang & Bomdilla - You should not miss the Upper Gompa at Bomdilla). On 22nd Mar 11 Started early morning (06:30 AM) to Guwahat and reached Guwahati at 4:30 PM.
Though the strech can be done with small size car, SUV with 4 wheel drive is recommended. If self driving one should be extra careful between Balukpong and Bomdilla where one may encounter dense fog and cloud. Here you can experience driving through clouds. The weather at Sela pass is chilling. So before you step out at Sela Pass wear adequate Warm clothing with woollen cap or muffler. Our hired SUV (Innova) got stuck in the snow on the way back to Guwahati. Army Personnels are there to help keep the pass open for traffic and extend help to every body. Even we helped one Maruti 800 which got stuck in snow.
So it is advisable to cross Sela pass before noon & have 4 wheel drive as weather is un predictable and goes bad generally in the afternoon. Start early in the morning so that the destination can be reached before dark. To visit Bumla pass, permit from Distric magistrate is required.
Visted in mid March 2011. Best season is April - November

Drive from Guwahati/Tezpur. Break journey at Bomdila or Dirang. Roads are a bit dicey; so give enough time for landslides and other unforeseen circumstances. Throughout the way, you will get basic food like dal chawal and vegetables; and at certain places maggi and momos.
Give enough time to recuperate from the journey; even though we were a group of 20 year olds, we were a bit tired.

A beuatiful Cloudy Ride
Post by Dageesh
Reach Gauwahati by Train/Air, hire vehicles like Sumo to Pajoro based on your budget. Small cars should be strictly avoided
Book hotels well before your journey.
You can get help from friendly Military camps that'll be found across your ride to Tawang.
The road is porne to land slides.

Best of Best
Post by Chinmoy | Guwahati | Mar 26, 2013
Tawang could be reached both by air and road. But I would suggest road, as for me the travel itself is a cherished memory and in this way you could travel through some of the most amazing places and be a part of the history. But again the travel is not for some leisure loving and weak heart people. And be extra cautious while travelling in the months of Dec-March.

A ROAD TO THE HEAVEN.

On the way to tawang
Post by Amitabha | Kolkata | Mar 13, 2013
From guwahati to valukpong, valukpong to bomdila Tejpur to valukponf road is more or less good,then the road is quite bad more or less 45 kilometer Avoid tejpur to valukpong after evening
n.b:- Inner line permit is necessary to visit Arunachal pradesh,you can do it from Guwahati, or one can do it from saltlake kolkata from arunachal bhaban

A pleasant surprise
Post by Debjit
Travel in Arunachal is very tough & you need to hire a car from any point & travel from either Itanagar or Guwahati. Roads are very bad & it's a no no entry during the monsoons.

Experience at Bomdila
Post by Manish
For going to Bomdila, one can come to Tezpur Airport by Flight & go there by Reserved or Shared Tata Sumo as said earlier. One should have patience during such long Journey.
One must have Inner Line Permit (ILP) for going there. Otherwise,you will be denied entry & get down at Assam Border. ILP can be received at Guwahati, New Delhi, Tezpur & Kolkata.

Travelling Tips to Mangaldai



Nice place to visit 
Post by U | Bangalore | May 31, 2011
1. Reach fro any city of India by Flight to LGB International Airport or By train reach Guwahati train station.
2. Bus service available form Maskhowa or Adabari bus stop towards Mangaldai. (Better take ASTC bus) or rent a Taxi (Cost Rs. 1000 to max Rs.1300... do not pay Rs. 1500)
3. Guwahati to Mangaldai 70km only ( 1.5 hours journey )
4. Hotel Madhuban, Hotel Shyamalee is better choice to stay

Travelling Tips to Shillong



The Road through the Land of the Clouds
Post by Subhasree | Pune | Mar 1, 2007
Lots of companies run bus services through Meghalaya. However, book tickets a few days in advance if desirous of taking the AC luxury buses [recommended]. Due to sensitive situation in these places, it is strongly recommended that one avoids night bus journey. Please dress soberly and do not enter into debates on political or sectarian issues.

Shillong a Place In Cool Mist & Mellow 
Post by Subhankar
Guwahati is well connected with rest of India. From Guwahati, Shillong it is only three to four hours journey depending upon transport you choose. Apart from taxi, Govt. run tourist buses are available from Guwahati airport and railway station.
It is better to carry food pack & water in road transport. I always advise to book hotel before you reach there for tension free journey. Dependable websites, like presently you are going through, are there to help you.

In the Land of the Clouds 
Post by Dibyendu | Kolkata | Jun 1, 2011
The best time to relish Meghalaya is at the onset of the of the monsoon when the clouds descend to kiss the pristine hills & the sun plays hide-n-seek adding a surreal setting to the landscape. The best route by train is to avail the Saraighat from Howrah which reaches Guwahati around 9.30am. A journey of 3hrs by car takes one to Shillong.

Shillong
Post by Vikas
Well there are no special tips. However since it is the land of clouds, you must be prepared lest a sudden downpour catches you unaware.
I landed at Guwahati airport and took a taxi to Shillong, however there is another airport around 25 kms from Shillong at a place called UMRI (I hope I remember the name right). Carry less luggage and enjoy your heart out!

Shillong-heaven in the clouds
Post by Abhi | Kolkata | Oct 14, 2008
Finally its nice to stay at Umium lake resort for one/two days, the beauty of the lake is far better than the much hyped Dal-lake in Srinagar. Prior booking is a must for that resort. Enjoy the unspoiled nature to the fullest extent in Shillong.

Travelling Tips to Cherrapunjee



Meghalaya - a place to behold....
Post by SHUBRO | Bangalore | Jul 5, 2010
Reached Guwahati from Kolkata by flight. Took taxi from airport to Shillong. Stayed in Shillong club, which was expensive but nice (right at the heart of the city). From there, we took the help of Pradip-da (9863087418), who was more than just a taxi-driver. He was our local guide, shopping guide, everything. We drove in his car to different parts of Meghalaya for 3.5 days but I wish I had few more days to enjoy more of the scenic beauty of Meghalaya. It was raining a lot and was cold also - so need to take appropriate gear for that.

Cherrapunjee - A Untouched beauty...
Post by Pamp | Chandigarh | May 27, 2010
To reach Cherrapunjee : From Guwahati you can hire a cab or take a state transport bus too... but I'll prefer to consult a trip planner agency to schedule your trip for you.

Rains in Cherrapunjee
Post by Shantanu | Guwahati | May 3, 2009
To travel to Cherrapunjee, reach Guwahati first by air or rail, take a taxi or a bus to Shillong, enjoy a couple of days there, and then take another taxi to Cherra. From Guwahati, the whole trip of 4 days will cost no more than 10 thousand (including fare). While returning, dont forget to drop in for a couple of days at Guwahati. It has the best sunset, over the Brahmaputra, the world has to offer!

Can reach by car from shillong. Approximately 90 kms from Shillong. Must not miss the ride from shillong to Cherranpunjee. The beautiful strips of gorges will keep you spellbound throughout the journey.

Travelling Tips to Tura



Heaven on the Earth!!!!
Post by NSingh
The nearest airport toTura is Guwahati & from there you can take Sumo Taxi Service or Catch a night bus.
Warning : Please dont try to go from Guwahati latenight by hired taxi as on the way some places are effected by the millitants.Its better to travel in daytime.
In tura dont argue with the people or auto drivers on the topic on politics otherwise you can put yourself in a big trouble.
Whenever you go for the rivers please do ask the local people if you are planing to swim in the river & without any guide dont try to enter the forest area of Tura.
Please dont miss-understand me but these are just some precatiouns so you can take care of yourself if you are travelling alone.
I know you all will love it when you will reach your this Holiday Destination & if till then i will open my mix branded shop there do visit it with your all family hehehheheh.So all my friends happy & save Jouney......

Tura one of the Heaven on the earth.
Post by NSingh
The best time to visit Tura is in Christmas & new year eve.The nearest airport to Tura is Guwhati airport 250 or 300kms from Tura from there you can go by taxi or buses.You can go from the helicopter service from Meghalaya Tourism but it runs only on some specified days in a week.
Warnings : Please dont take it lightly :
From Guwahati dont try to go alone & if you are going by private taxi better not to travel at night time cause many places on the way are effected by some bad groups.
When you go to any jungle or waterfall or riverside in Tura please dont try to play with the nature over there do ask local people there how safe it is cause many places there are effected by witchcraft practicing people.SO PLEASE DONT PLAY WITH NATURE THERE.
Dont try to get in any argument with the youngsters or auto drivers related to anything
specially politics & if you think you have a warm blood try to keep it calm there otherwise you will be a Deadman.
Dear Readers dont think i am threatening you but that's just for you so you can be aware.I have visited that places more than 10times & still do visit.I love that place like anything in this world.

Garo Hills: land of myths and legends
Post by Alva
How to get to Tura:- Air: The nearest international airport is the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport at Borjhar, Guwahati. Fliers also have the option of disembarking at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Kolkata then flying into Guwahati on any of Indian, Jet Airways, SpiceJet, Kingfisher Airlines, Deccan or Indigo flights. Direct flights to Guwahati are also available from New Delhi. The Pawan Hans helicopter service run by the state-owned Meghalaya Transport Corporation flies on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from Guwahati (Rs. 1,525) and Shillong (Rs. 1,200). Travel light. The maximum baggage allowed is 10 kg with no hand-baggage; also, children below the age of 10 are not permitted to fly.
Rail: The nearest railhead Guwahati is well connected from other parts of the country. Trains are available everyday to Guwahati from Kolkata's Howrah Station and take around 18 hours. Guwahati also has direct trains from New Delhi. India's fastest train, the Rajdhani Express takes about 36 hours. Trains from the South India include the Bangalore-Guwahati Express, Chennai-Guwahati Express and Guwahati-Trivandrum Express. A word of caution, do check ahead for strikes, road blockades or any agitation programme. The region is politically unstable and getting stranded en route a less desirable option.
Road: Buses ply from Kolkata to Guwahati via Siliguri with the option of breaking journey at Siliguri. Buses to Tura are available both from Siliguri and Guwahati, although the latter is the better and more convenient option. There are two slots for the bus service; the earliest is 0630 hrs and the latest 2030 hrs. This journey takes around seven hours and a seat for one costs Rs. 250. Buses leave from the newly built Inter-State Bus Terminal. Sumo (jeep) shared services are available twice a day (7 am and 2pm) from Baralumukh in Guwahati. A seat will cost Rs 300 per head and take 5 hours. For the heavier built, consider blocking (and paying for) two seats, drivers tend to pack the vehicle pretty tight.

MY AIZAWL VISIT
Post by Nripen
Direct flight from guwahati to aizawl available. Need to prepare 'inner line permit' which can be made in airport lounge. Airport to aizawl is 32 kms and local taxis are avalable. You can reach by road from silchar which is 8-9 hours journey from silchar. Bus and sumo service available from silchar.

Travelling Tips to Champhai





Romance of Mountains and Sea of Mist
Post by Dolly | Gurgaon | Nov 28, 2011
The entire state runs on time-bound sumo service for which you have to buy tickets beforehand (they get sold very soon).
Ticket rates:
Aizawl to Champhai- Rs. 350 per person
Champhai to Zokhawtar- Rs. 50 per person.
If traveling in morning then opt for seat numbers 3 and 4
Between mornings and late noon go for seats 5 and 6
If traveling in evening then you can go for any seats from 1 to 6.
7,8,9,10 are the seats at the back and they are very bumpy and stuffy so avoid them if you can.
Seats 3 and 4 have the outlet for the passengers at the back seat so be prepared to get out when their stops come.
Also, be seated well in advance because they are very punctual (may delay only for 15-20 minutes) and also to avoid confrontation with people who might sit on your seat and refuse to understand your language and budge.
The only official stops between Aizawl and Champhai is at Saitual (80 kms from Aizawl) where you can attend to the natures call or have some tea and snacks.
People hardly know any lingo other than Mizo so be prepared with a few words for your own help.
The problem is not so much of language as of attitude because people are not very helpful and friendly. They will seldom smile at you though they will laugh at you lot.
Other General Tips:
Most autos have official rate charts so do see it as part of the fare negotiation.
Taxis are very costly in the entire state since its a mountain state.
People sleep early so order your food well in advance at the lodge. Also, plan your trip such that you reach the lodge by 6 or 7pm max. It gets very dark by then.
Shops close by 5 pm and even the eateries shut down by 7pm max.

Travelling Tips to Kohima



The Hill Queen
Post by Gopa | Kolkata | Apr 5, 2011
In many states of the North-East India you require Inner Line Permit. Specially foreigners need definitely. As our team consisted of all female members we had no problem although at borders of two states police check for permits. Tribals of Nagaland are to be handled carefully. In older times they were un-famous for human head hunting. You can reach Kohima by road from either Dimapur of Jorhat in Assam. Both Dimapur and Jorhat can be reached by air from Kolkata.

Kohima
Post by Anand | Bangalore | Oct 10, 2011
AIR : DIMAPUR is the only Airport in Nagaland at the moment. Direct flights connect the airport to Guwahati and Kolkota.
RAIL : Dimapur has a railway station on the main line of the North east Frontier Railway. It is well connected to Guwahati, with a number of trains that shuttle between the two stations every day.
ROAD : A number of taxis ply from Dimapur to Kohima. Prefer local shared taxi's over these buses. Night buses connect Dimapur and Kohima to Guwahati and Shillong (Meghalaya). A very convenient way for reaching Kohima is to take the train or flight to Dimapur and then rent a taxi to Kohima. The Dimapur taxi stand is adjacent to the Railway Station. Yellow taxis can be hired with other passengers (shared taxi) or exclusive (full taxi). One way fare from Dimapur Station to Kohima will be about 175/- per person for a shared cab.

Travelling Tips to Gangtok



SIKKIM - a must visit destination for nature lovers
Post by milsum | Pune | Feb 21, 2011
We reached Bagdogra airport at about 2.00 pm. A taxi booth is available at the airport for booking taxi (sumo/max and even Innova) to Gangtok. it takes about 4-5 hrs and cost ranges from Rs. 1600/- to Rs 2200/-. The taxis are not allowed directly to your hotel in Gangtok city if you reach there before 5.00 pm. They will drop you at taxi stand where you have to hire another taxi for local travel (Maruti van/Wagon r). Since we reached in evening the taxi driver dropped us at hotel (Mintokling guest house) by charging extra rs.200/-.

Gateway to Sikkim
Post by Amit | Bangalore | Apr 27, 2006
The closest airport is in Bagdogra, West Bengal, about 5-6 hours drive from Gangtok. There are regular flights from Kolkotta, Delhi and other cities.
The closest train station is NJP (Siliguri) in north Bengal, also about 4-6 hours drive. Good roads connect Gangtok with Darjeeling, NJP, and Bagdogra.
Roads within Sikkim are really good. Avoid travel in the winter and monsoon. Landslides are common in the mountain roads.

Gangtok + Nathu La review
Post by Globetrotter | Kolkata | Oct 29, 2008
The major entry-point for Gangtok is Siliguri. Siliguri can be reached by the following means:
(A) By air - Bagdogra is the nearest airport. Bagdogra has daily connectivity with Kolkata, Guwahati and Delhi. Bagdogra is 14 kms from Siliguri. From Siliguri, you have innumerable options to reach Gangtok (bus and taxi). Take a pre-paid taxi from Bagdogra airport to SNT (Sikkim National Transport) bus-stand. It will cost you Rs 260. There is also a North Bengal Transport bus-stand which is in the same road.
From Bagdogra you can also have a helicopter ride to Gangtok; cost Rs 2000. Bagdogra airport has a counter from where bookings for the helicopter ride can be done. For more info, probably some other sources needs to be checked.
(B) By train - New Jalpaiguri (NJP) is the nearest rail-station. It is 12 kms from Siliguri. NJP has daily connectivity with trains from Kolkata, Delhi and Guwahati. From Mumbai, there is a train Dadar-Guwahati express which goes via NJP.
Once you reach Siliguri, ask for SNT bus-stand or NBSTC (North Bengal State Transport Corp) stand. Both the bus-depots are on the same main road about 1 to 2 km apart.
(1) SNT buses leave every hour for Gangtok. The last bus leaves at 13:30 hours. It is sometimes difficult to get a bus without waiting as there
is a queue. Ideally, you might get a ticket for a bus which departs after 1 hour.
(2) A better option would be to settle for a shared cab (Sumo, MaxX, Qualis, etc). They are usually 10-seaters (2 besides the driver, 4 in the middle and 4 at the back). We being a couple chose the front-seat from where you get a good view while
travelling. The only disadvantage of sitting at the front is for the person sitting next to the driver often being poked at due to the gear being adjusted. The cost is Rs 150 per person. Usually, if its the holiday season one needn't wait much for the taxis to get filled (we waited 15 minutes). During non-holiday season, the drivers usually depart before its even full
and you might get a bargain also in terms of price. We paid Rs 120 per person while returning.
A private taxi can also be booked for around Rs 1500.
There are lots of shared-taxis around the SNT bus-stand so locating one will not be a problem. The entire stretch has lot of private tourist buses also if one needs to inquire further.
The entire Siliguri-Gangtok route is 114 km and it will take anywhere from 3.5 to 4.5 hours to commute. Do not miss the following in your journey:
1. Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary (15-20 km from Siliguri). Though we didn't sight anything out of the ordinary.
2. Teesta river which accompanies you for the major part of the journey offers some breath-taking views and photo-ops.
3. More than half-way into your journey, there is a stretch along the river where there are options for river-rafting both for swimmers and non-swimmers. The more adventurous can try it out. But its better to negotiate with the driver if you want to do so before you start your journey.
4. Soon on entering Sikkim, the Sikkim-Manipal Technology University on the banks of the river is a sight to behold.
While returning from Gangtok, you have the following options:
(1) Catch a helicopter ride to Bagdogra. The Sikkim Tourism office at the start of MG Marg provides you with booking options.
(2) Go to Deorali bus-stand and catch a bus or shared taxi to Siliguri.
There could be other options also but they need to be explored.
Precautions:
For the long hilly-rides, its better to carry medicines like Avomine (for Nausea and dizziness). Don't travel on an empty stomach and eat light before you travel, or else it will aggravate the problem. Maximum people were afflicted by nausea. I am no doctor, but I used a Avomine tablet as a precaution before my journey and it served its purpose. Carry an umbrella as the rains are unpredictable.
People with breathing problems and a weak heart might face an issue at Nathu La as the oxygen content is low and even healthy people had to struggle to walk-up a few steps. Such people should consult a doctor before travelling.

Travelling Tips to Pelling



Quet and outside the hustle of crowd :- nature loving and friendly Pelling
Post by Anupam | Delhi | Apr 25, 2006
The nearest airport is Bagdogra near siliguri
and the nearest rail head is New JalpaiGuri 6 kms from Siliguri .
From Siliguri you can hire a car or qualis or sumo and reach Pelling in 5 hrs. The road from Siliguri to Pelling is very steepy and narrow.Hence it is advisable to go by car/ qualis rather than by bus.
Also bus services is not so frequent... once a day

A lovely and a peaceful destination
Post by Abhi | Kolkata | Jul 16, 2012
Take a cab on hire to pelling if u r more than 7 and less than 10 , trip costs about Rs2500 to pelling from Njp.Or else u can take aauto rickshaw to SNT busstand and take the one and only bus to pelling Rs135 each , seats are good and comfortable journey too.

A calm serene place
Post by Suparna | Guwahati | Oct 12, 2011
You can reach Pelling both from Siliguri as well as Gangtok within 4-5 hours. Private cabs or shared ones (Mahindra Max). Approx. Rs 300/- from both places per seat. Reserved cabs will be around 3000 - 4000 rupees depending on availability. You should start early or else there may be less shared cabs. Take anti vomiting tablets half an hour before starting if you have problems in heights and twist and turns.

Pelling, West Sikkim
Post by Anindya  | Kolkata | Jan 4, 2011
Shared/reserved jeeps from NJP station/Siliguri to pelling via jorethang. Alternatively, SNTS buses from Siliguri. Carry heavy woollen garments, flash lights (load shedding is a common problem in pelling) and last but not the least, a medicine kit.

Pelling - God's own land
Post by shenga | Kolkata | Sep 7, 2009
From New Jalpaiguri, take an Indica or Mahindra Max or Tata Sumo to Pelling, or you could go to SNT bus terminus and take a bus to Pelling. Or else you could go to Jorthang by jeep of same make from the jeep stand alongside the bus terminus, it is about about 2hr to 2hr.30 mins journey and then take another jeep to Pelling from Jorthang. The total journey will take you 4hr to 4hr.30 mins from New Jalpaiguri. Be careful about the fare from NJP, during off-season it is Rs.1500.00 and in season, it goes upto Rs.2200.00. If the trip is via Jorthang, then fare for each person is about Rs.180.00 to Rs.200.00 from SNT jeep stand to Pelling.

Travelling Tips to Lachung



The place where sky meets earth.
Post by Praveen | Poso | May 31, 2012
The travel route is very narrow, stoney and full of twists and turns.. Small children and people with sensitive stomach should be careful..vomiting, nausea can happen. When you reach top even breathing may become difiicult for some people.

God's gift to us
Post by Nanda | Vijaywada | Jun 15, 2010
Do not travel during monsoon and when you get there contribute to the efforts of the local Govt. to keep the mountains clean and green by not using plastic and not littering around.

Travelling Tips to Yuksam



One Day in Yuksom is not Enough
Post by Zen | Mumbai | Jun 20, 2008
Yuksom can be reached by road either from Bagdogra or Gangtok. Be sure to leave either city early in the morning, for it is a long drive and the roads in the latter half of the drive are in a bad condition.

Yuksam- a silent paradise
Post by Indrajyoti | Kolkata | Jan 9, 2013
One can travel by train to New Jalpaigarsuri or travel by air to Bagdogra. The roads in the hills are mostly broken, so people with back problems should ideally travel in big cars with good shock absorbers or else may just land up with a Disc Prolapse.

Travelling Tips to Nathula



Mesmerising wonders of nature
Post by Lipsa  | Bhubaneshwar | Jun 28, 2012
To visit this place you need to have travel permits which one needs to get before oneday and start as early as possible and try to return before Noon as the weather sometimes becomes too rough and during heavy rain there can be land slide and being at such a high altitude, people may feel breathlessness . So acclimatised yourself with Gangtok first and then proceed to Nathula.

Nathula Pass - Heaven on Earth
Post by Mahesh | Bangalore | Aug 9, 2011
Hire a taxi from Gangtok which goes to Nathula.Bargain and see that the driver can take you till then original Baba mandir at around 15000 feet else catch your hotel guy and arrange for the trip.. Be sure to carry lot of photo copies of your ID card. The journey is very bumpy and climb to the temple might cause you some breathing problems because of altitude. Carry warm clothing as it extremely cold during winters.
